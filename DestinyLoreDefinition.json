When I asked her if five Guardians would be enough to protect us from the Kings, she launched into a speech about how being a Guardian means protecting people no matter what. \n\nI know what that means: “Five is not enough. Everyone here is going to die.” \n\nI could run. Same fantasy I've been nursing for years: rappel down from the eastern tallwalk, make for the coast. Conar says that tunnel I can see from the tallwalk—it's full of Fallen. Open spaces like the road are safer. With this information I could probably make it ten whole kilometers from the village before I'm killed.  \n\nThat's four more than I could have otherwise. Maybe it's worth a shot. \n\n—Diary of Himura Shinobu",

Thus my undergraduate was able to extract long passages of rules and records pertaining to several types of hastiludes, including the joust, behourd, and tupinaire.  \n\nI may be spending too much time with Guardians, because my first thoughts upon seeing these extraordinary findings were that, if the Sparrow Racing League crowd ever got their hands on them, the results would be disastrous.

The theory in vogue right now with the Followers of Osiris is that the first five verses refer to the Black Garden, the coming of Ghaul, the Traveler's awakening and Ghaul's subsequent defeat. It's a convincing interpretation, even conceding that prophecies are much easier to interpret in hindsight.\nThere's just one thing: if Osiris used the Infinite Forest to develop his prophecies, and the Infinite Forest cannot accurately simulate Light, how did Osiris predict the Traveler would wake? The Forest's very inability to predict this very thing is what prevented Panoptes from breaking ground with its apocalyptic calculations.\nI must assume: 1) Either verse 5 does not refer to the Traveler's awakening, or 2) Osiris has prophetic resources at his disposal other than the Forest.

For every rule obeyed, there's a rule broken. \n\nBabies don't learn their native tongue through rules. They learn it through exposure, absorption. And until I roll up my sleeves and get to work, Rasputin is mankind's most expensive baby. \n\nSo far, so good… if you set your goals realistically. Forget Rasputin for a moment; that's something I'm just not good at. If you look at me with the tiniest shred of approval, I'll kill myself to please you. \n\nI have some issues. So I am going to make Rasputin a breakthrough construct. I fed him—should be \"it,\" but I don't care—I fed him digitized copies of every major work of literature as a foundation for language use.",

One will breach the hull of a one-seat planetjumper, instantly killing its pilot. The other path will disable a Venusian pleasure craft, leaving its inhabitants alive but certain to die of starvation before they can be found. \n\nTo my surprise, when given this problem, Rasputin actually rendered a verdict. \n\nI'm not going to tell you what it is, because I want you to enjoy your next Venusian pleasure craft trip. \n\n\nRasputin continues to develop by leaps and bounds. \n\nIn a trial simulation, he successfully interpreted the meaning of corrupted, borderline incomprehensible data from a damaged warsat.  This is exactly the sort of function we need him to fill. But that wasn't the amazing part. \n\nThe mind-blower was that without proof, evidence, or conscious reasoning, Rasputin sensed which warsat was in trouble. \n\nYou heard me.

A gift from Rasputin. \n\nI think he's ready to go online. \n\n\nI guess I saw this coming, but it was still a blow. \n\nI arrived in the lab this afternoon to discover that Rasputin has discarded my communications protocols. He's replaced them with a system-wide program that he himself designed. \n\nHis voice is unlike anything that has ever existed. It is both haunting and lovely. It is also terrifyingly efficient. \n\nHe's also begun upgrading warsats with new capabilities of his own invention, and I'm not entirely sure what those abilities are. It's exactly the goal we were striving towards, this level of autonomous control, and I know I should be celebrating. \n\nMy work here is done.

The Vex have now reacted.\n\nHe throws off his poncho, rising with revolver and deflection grenade in his fists, screaming challenge. Jutting from the Martian desert before them is the canted, fringed hoop that is the Black Garden's Gate, huge enough to swallow a Fallen Skiff. It thrills with infinite energy.\n\nOut of that aperture emerges the behemoth silhouette of a Vex Gate Lord, metal and mind crashing together, self-assembling, ready to defend this secret place. The Vex are born here, in the sense of baptism: consecrated to the service of some terrible purpose that the machines found within.\n\n\"Hey, big guy!\" Uldren shouts. \"Over here!!\"\n\nCalmly, carefully, Jolyon Till the Rachis begins to fire his rifle straight up into the sky.

Uldren whoops and hip-fires a couple rounds into the sand at its feet. \"Can you dance, sir?\" he bellows. \"Have you got the footwork?\"\n\nInside the Vex entity, there are mighty algorithms constructing a model of this merely temporal place, calculating potential threat, weighing the utility of weapons discharge against the good that power might do elsewhere. This computation is the only reason Uldren's still alive.\n\nThe bone mic tuned to Cabal tactical channels wakes up at Uldren's throat. They have localized the sound of Jolyon's rifle and are responding. He hollers up at the Vex behemoth and starts to jig. \"It's going to rain on Mars! It's monsoon season in Meridian Bay! Did you see the forecast?\"\n\nHe grabs Jol by the hand and pulls. Together they sprint toward the Gate Lord and its charge.

A perfect sphere of topologically defective space-time blinks into being around him. He holds Jolyon close, and together they calm their breath. The barrier is impenetrable, but it will not last long. Until then there is only so much air to breathe.\n\nOutside, the full fury of a Cabal fleet carrier lands on the Gate Lord.\n\nWhen the barrier fades, the Gate Lord is dead, and Uldren and Jolyon are no longer on Mars.",

He has a dreadful image of his fingernails developing into tight down-curved loops that curl around back into his fingers, completing a hideous circuit to their root. It's awful and yet it's wonderful, in a transgressive way, in a newborn-screaming way.

Uldren moves with cold, vicious anger. War here in the Garden. Petty, detestable war, brought into this place by some blundering Cabal expedition. They deserved what they got. The Garden must be left to tend itself, mustn't it? It must be allowed to evolve its secret fruits…\n\nThe terrain dips. The red flowers fade away to low, woven grasses. The wind whispers… soft words, sentences with just the beginnings of syntax, the cadence almost musical. \"Brain stain,\" Jolyon whispers, fearing infection by a contagious idea. \"We should…\" But his voice trails off as Uldren pushes ahead, down into a low vale, slipping easily through tangled undergrowth. Vex. There are Vex here, dozens of Goblins and Minotaurs, still as statues and covered in moss, in a ring like some robotic henge. They are singing in faint, wraithlike notes of inhuman clarity. Uldren knows what this place must be.\n\nThe Cabal Legionary huddles behind a stone. Uldren creeps forward. By the time the wounded bellowing thing knows he's there, he has a knife pressed to its helmet, right above the cleft of its lips and the soft tissues below. \"Don't move,\" he says, in Ulurant. \"Don't speak. This knife is atom-sharp.\"\n\n\"I can tell,\" the Legionary grunts in its native tongue. \"It's roight up in me eyes. Practically shavin' me bristles.\"\n\n\"Do you know where you are?\"\n\n\"Just abou' the worst place anyone's ever gone?\"\n\n\"You say that because you can't smell the air,\" Uldren says. \"It's sweet. Like pollen and thunder. Why did you come here?\"\n\n\"Not by any chance of oir own, ser. The milk robots abducted us.\"\n\nThe whispers have taken on a soft hint of Ulurant grammar, confirming Uldren's suspicion. This is a place where abstract patterns war for survival, fighting to propagate themselves by preying on each other. The Vex are singing to see how the Garden changes their song, and even this conversation has fertilized the air. \"Why are they here? What do they want?\"\n\n\"They come 'ere to pray, ser. They're makin' vessels ou' of themselves. They're the wors' things ever to be, ser. They 'ate existence.\"\n\n\"How do you know this?\"\n\n\"Oh, frum the seeds, ser,\" the Legionary says. \"Do yeh see them?\" And without hesitation or second thought, he punches the emergency medic release on his helmet. The pressure seal breaks and a ring of black gel sprays out, hissing. The Legionary slumps over. His helmet tumbles into his broad lap.\n\nBeneath the layer of gel, the whole surface of his skull has the pitted texture of a strawberry. Thousands of tiny seeds glisten in the Cabal's flesh. Uldren brushes the skin in fascination.\n\n\"Uldren,\" Jolyon radios, \"I really don't like the expression on your face.\"\n\n\"This place has secrets,\" the prince murmurs back. The bone mic feels cold and inorganic, poorly mated to his flesh, compared to the warm, close-packed pits of the Legionary's deformed skull. \"So many secrets… They grew in him, Jolyon. The Garden grew its secrets in him.\"\n\n\"Who gives a rat?\" Jolyon snaps. \"Your Highness, we've got to get out of here. Before whatever happened to them happens to us too!\"\n\nHe's afraid of secrets, Uldren realizes. The unknown terrifies him. Which is very sensible. Very rational. The attitude of a good scout, a good soldier, a survivor.\n\nBut Uldren can't stop imagining how astonished Mara would be at this place. What if he could bring her here?

        "description": "\"The heart…\" Uldren considers his sister's question. After a while his memories become confused. He was running through a thorny grove, and the branches and prickles were tearing at his cheeks. Huge wet fruits slapped against his shoulders and detonated in overripe pulp. Fruits shaped like heavy, swollen Ghosts. He was huddled with Jolyon beneath a thick cobweb, holding his breath, as they listened to voices argue just outside. His heartbeat… was it his heartbeat? Or another's?\n\nHe was in an apartment block. He remembers that. He was sitting in the laundry room, a place with a black-and-white checkered tile floor, watching his crows tumble over and over in the dryer, black feathers flurrying, beaks clacking. A big old female Cabal sat in the tub to his left, scrubbing her back with a wire brush. A Vex Goblin with the face of Alis Li in its stomach stood behind the counter, selling detergent. \"Uldren,\" she said, \"you've got a hole in you.\" The Cabal grunted in agreement. He looked down at himself and there was a hole in his hand, black and perfectly round. His dryer ran out of time, but his crows were still wet.\n\n\"Uldren.\" Mara, shaking him. She does not ordinarily touch anyone. \"Did you see the heart?\"\n\nIt seems the most natural thing in the world that a garden should have a heart. \"The Vex infest the place,\" he says. \"It gives them something they crave. It… grows them toward what they want to be.\"\n\n\"You didn't answer the question,\" Mara says coolly. It's a perfectly sensible observation. It's the strangest thing Uldren has ever heard her say.\n\n\"Whatever the heart of that place is,\" he says, pacing, \"it's a seed, I think, a seed left behind to grow. Like a… a node of Glimmer. Or…\" The idea strikes him as a thunderbolt. \"Or a tripwire. Bait to attract those who seek out and destroy what they don't understand.\"\n\nBait for Guardians. Bait to mark some milestone in the Traveler's recovery.\n\n\"I told you never to go there,\" Mara says. Her eyes burn. She draws her cloak tight. \"Are you not devoted to me?\"\n\n\"Sister,\" he says, \"of course I am.\"\n\n\"Yet you defy me.\"\n\nYes, Uldren thinks. Yes, aren't those the same thing? How could you care at all for something that never surprises you?\n\nHe feels suddenly, utterly alone.",

        "description": "When he sees Jolyon in the arsenal, the realization of his own sheer unbelievable inconsiderate disgraceful boorishness makes Uldren gasp aloud in horror. \"Hey,\" he calls, roughly. He's not sure how to apologize. He hasn't spoken to Jolyon since they returned from the Garden. He didn't commend Jolyon to the Queen or throw him a fete for his bravery or even ask if he was sleeping all right after… after everything. He forgot about him.\n\n\"Hey,\" Jolyon says, not looking up. \"You weren't at the range yesterday.\"\n\n\"Oh, you don't even need a spotter,\" Uldren says, trying to tease him. But it comes off flat and dismissive. \"I've been, uh.\" Dreaming. Recording his dreams. Poring feverishly through the Origin Libraries, searching for confirmation of what his heart wants so desperately to be true. The future of the Awoken could lie in that Garden. There is a wellspring of Light on Earth, a blinding beacon that will only grow brighter. The Awoken will not survive, not as they are; Mara's vision and the truth of their origins will be lost, diluted by the anodyne philosophy of those Cityborn ideologues. The Guardians will kill everything they find.\n\nWhat if the Garden is the Traveler's antithesis? What if the Awoken can find in that Garden a new place of balance, an equipotential between the darkness and the light? As the light brightens the shadows deepen—\n\nJolyon is saying something. \"Sorry,\" Uldren grunts, fussing with his revolver. \"What was that?\"\n\n\"I said, we should talk about what happened in there.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" He realizes now how afraid he was that Jolyon wouldn't see the significance of the place. Revulsion and fear, yes, natural responses, but he must see past them. \"Yes, we've got to record all our observations before they fade. I should've asked you sooner—\"\n\n\"Uldren, I don't want anyone to know what we saw.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" This kindles a little bonfire of warmth in his gut. \"Of course. No one else has to know. Our shared secrets, hm?\"\n\n\"I wish I didn't remember what I saw,\" Jolyon says, fumbling his rifle's firing pin. It hits the floor like a dull chime and rolls under his bench. He doesn't go after it. \"And I don't keep secrets.\"\n\nUldren thinks about this for a moment. The profound truth of it hits him like a cold wind. \"You don't, do you?\" Jolyon knows exactly where he was born, to what lineage. His capabilities as a marksman are public record. As one of Uldren's Crows, he flies dangerous surveillance missions, but he is not a covert operative. Uldren knows… everything about him.\n\n\"You gonna be on the range tomorrow?\" Jolyon asks, too casually. \"Thought we might shoot a few magazines.\"\n\n\"Not tomorrow,\" Uldren says. \"I have work to do.\" He is already trying to imagine how Mara would react if he tries to turn the Oracle Engine on the Garden. The things he might learn… the things she will surely want to know…",

As he staggers down the edge of a Martian chasm, he can feel the drop calling to him, begging him to join her. To end it all. The heat of the place soaks him in sweat. The dead chassis of one of his old Crow drones, slung over his back, feels like it's compressing his ribs, pushing his lungs up against his sternum, expelling his breath.\n\nHe needs the drone to fix his ship. Again. He must get off Mars. He must start looking for her.\n\nThe weight of the Crow drone slams him down on hands and knees. His vision swims—stars and shining Harbingers soaring through the ring plane and a wall of terrible light—and he sees the moment the Dreadnaught took everything from him, the moment his sister finally, absolutely, utterly ran out of secret plans. That instant when all sound ceased and he screamed denial and yet—in spite of his soul's plea to die with her—reached for the deflection shield that saved his life.\n\nHe crawls until he can rest in the shadow of a dead Vex block.\n\nHe crashed in the Candor Isles, not so far from the Gate to the Garden. The place where he saw another path for the Awoken. Why had Mara never accepted his invitation?\n\nHe has been hearing her. Thirst hallucinations, surely. But there is that hum, that whisper, that thrill of starlight in his skull…\n\nA flock of his Crow drones found his crash site and repaired his fighter. He made it halfway to orbital velocity before a Cabal gun clawed him out of the sky and sent him crashing down in Hellas Basin. Now his Crows are dead and the fighter is probably beyond repair. And his sister is gone. His sister is GONE. And he followed her and all his people followed her because he and they were sure she had a PLAN she always had a PLAN something better than DYING BY THE THOUSANDS FOR A CITY THAT DOES NOT CARE.\n\nHe should go home. He should go home. If he can find a way. But will he have the strength? He cannot be the champion they loved. He cannot restore their faith in the purpose of the Awoken, or in his sister's design. He no longer believes.\n\nThis world is a carcass now. The scars of the Guardians' passage. Cabal fortresses reeking of decay, littered with flesh and bone and broken armor. The shattered chassis of Vex littering the sands. A place of death, death and war, a war that tilts on the fulcrum of the Traveler, brought upon it by the puppets of that Traveler, that fulcrum of war.\n\nThere is something in his eye. He blinks and blinks, trying to rub it away, and as he does, he struggles to hear her, to sense that prickle of starlight under his skin. She will tell him he is on the right path. She will tell him she's still alive.\n\nHe feels nothing.",

Prince Uldren of a ruined house, lesser of two siblings, bested by Skolas, blinded by Variks Less-Than-Dreg, squanderer of fleets, last of the Awoken nobility, last of his kind.\n\nWhen Uldren looks up at him, he does not even need to speak the truth. The Kell of Kings has named Uldren, and in doing so, it has named itself. The broken ruler of a broken house. The Last Kell.\n\n\"You can do what I cannot,\" the Kell tells Uldren. \"You broken, beaten thing. You have no pride, so you will lose nothing when you give the word that must be given. It is twilight for the Fallen, and we must lay our banners down.\"\n\nAnd to the groaned and growled protests of its court, the Kell of Kings kneels to Uldren. \"I bow to thee,\" it says, \"for in thy downfall and disgrace thou bearest the weakness we cannot. Thou shalt tell the Eliksni to tear off their banners. Thou shalt tell them that we must all surrender to each other. We must give up our rivalries, or we will not survive. Wilt thou do this for one dying people, Prince of another?\"\n\nHe will do it. He will gain soldiers, and ships, and resources to begin the search.

Uldren lives in constant suffering, a numb, scowling pain that drives him to Ether and worse distractions. He has never felt the Light this strong. He has never known pain so deep. How many centuries with his sister? And how quickly he's disintegrated without her… \n\nWhy won't she speak to him?\n\nThe Reef burns around him. Shattered asteroids and cracked habitats spill bright flakes of debris. There is nothing quite so stark and brilliant as sunlit wreckage in vacuum. The Reef is huge, huge, but dense too, its structures and people gathered in tight clusters against the vastness of space. Oryx and the Red Legion ripped great holes in the Reef. Oh, if only Uldren had told Petra that Trau'ug's Broken Legion was a Trojan horse; but Uldren has nothing to give to a \"regent\" who surrenders her people to the Traveler. She has always wanted Mara's approval, little Petra. Always wanted to ingratiate herself. But she's never understood what Mara respects; she's never been willing to take the hard road to Mara's trust. That's why Mara doesn't speak to Petra.\n\nBut Mara has not been speaking to Uldren either.\n\nHe kicks off the wrecked hull of the corvette. He and the Kings have been raiding the Asteroid Belt, knocking out shipping headed for Earth, trying to further destabilize the Reef. Uldren has killed his own subjects, and at first that left him wretched with guilt, curled up in the hard cell where he sleeps. But didn't Mara lead thousands of her subjects to their deaths for a still enigmatic greater good? How is this any different?\n\nShe has always intended her people for the altar. The Awoken are pawns in her design. It's up to Uldren to set that design back on track.\n\n\"Mara!\" he shouts up into the starlight. He has come too far to beg now. He's done too much. He demands her answer: \"I'm not angry. I forgive you for… for sacrificing yourself to save them. But you must answer me now! Am I on the right path? Am I nearer to finding you?\"\n\nHe has the House of Kings as allies. His raids on the Reef have forced Petra to pull back, consolidate, focus on protecting her citizens instead of collaborating with the Guardians. But is he any closer to Mara? Has he… can he trust himself to do this?\n\nHe always wanted to surprise Mara. To make her recalculate her plans.\n\nBut it would help him so much to know that she foresaw a little of this—to be certain he's headed the right way…\n\n\"Mara!\" he cries, blinking against the persistent soreness in his right eye. \"Sister, have you forsaken me?\"\n\nSomething answers him!",

He follows it in.\n\nAnd there it is. A Fallen Archon, crumpled in the dust. Ether hisses through entry and exit wounds cauterized by brutal Solar flames: the mark of the Golden Gun. Uldren hisses in disgust as he traces Guardians' footprints in the dust.

The victim is shaking now, trembling under Uldren's hands. He wants so badly to do something, anything, to ease the poor soldier's passing.

As tears stain the Archon's wounds, the Ether roiling through Uldren's fingers slowly grows heavier, darker, more noxious. He does not notice.\n\nFinally, he leans back to smear his knuckles across his eyes—sore, they're always so sore. Under the unmarked helmet, four dead eyes open in wonder.

Secrets are safe.\n\n\"Sister?\" he asks the wall of his quarters. Lately, in between bouts of euphoria, he's been sleeping too long.

It is the reward we so richly deserve, for we owe everything to Mara. It would be… wrong for us to outlive our purpose. Trust me. Life without her is worse than… worse than…\"\n\nHe chokes on it.

The Shore asks much of those who call it home. Most simply find their end through the harsh will of these harsh lands or by the hand of the hardened agents who stalk its fractured expanse—bandits, cutthroats, cannibals, Awoken patrols, Guardian \"heroes.\"\n\nThere are a billion ways to die among the jagged wilds of the Tangled Shore.

He saw the lie of the Archon's worship—how Servitors were revered upon a pedestal of godhood as a means to control the masses.\n\nMaybe there was a time when the Fallen theology was one with greater concerns. No more. The Houses fractured, at war with one another. Old graces long since neglected in favor of a more desperate purpose—survival.\n\nWhile cast low, Reksis found strength in his growing hatred. Only when he found common disdain among those twisted outcasts who would call themselves Scorned—who wore their hated derision as a badge of honor—did Reksis also find an outlet for his anger. His new brothers and sisters saw great value in his unchecked aggression. They were all a bit mad in their own right. All a bit twisted.\n\nBut where others slipped toward insanity, Reksis's mind and intent were clear—the agony of a terrible death was his aim. The target of his wickedness, the very Servitors he had been denied. The very machines that sustained the Fallen.\n\nHe would tear and slice and rend their metal until their hissing deaths rang across the Shore, the Reef… the entire system.

Instead, he found kin in the form of seven scorned. With them, he found purpose and power. As their legend grew, he found believers and new truth. His banishment was not penance, it was reward—for his convictions, for his courage.\n\nFikrul, the crazed fanatic. Fikrul, the heretic Archon who spoke against the very faith he once held dear. Scorned and forgotten—but only for so long.\n\nFikrul was a Dreg.\n\nBefore his banishment—before his clarity of purpose—Fikrul was a celebrated leader of Fallen faith and a savior to those who embraced his teaching.\n\nArchons had long been elevated in Fallen society, but their stature grew, and their role shifted following the Whirlwind. As desperation took hold and the last of the Fallen raced across the stars in search of salvation, their dependence on machines evolved into a deep-rooted need—their weapons to fight, their ships to fly, their Servitors to survive.\n\nThat need became worship. That worship became faith. And the Archons—those who oversaw the care and consecration of the Servitors—were looked upon to provide hope through their words, teachings, and interpretations of the machines' wants, needs… desires.\n\nBut Fikrul saw another path—one that would later be mimicked and twisted by the techno-deviant Splicers in the Plaguelands of Earth while he and his explored their own darker interpretations of faith.\n\nFikrul is a Fanatic.\n\nScorned and abandoned.\n\nFikrul is all who strive to regain strength of self and purpose. He is a survivor. He is the outcast priest of the broken plains, and his sermon is death and all the glory that follows.\n\nIn Fikrul's eyes, and those of the outcasts who rallied to his philosophies, machines were not superior. They were not gods. They were tools. Instruments to be mastered and controlled and manipulated in service of Eliksni pride. None should grovel for Ether. None should have their honor bound to the whims of manufactured deities.\n\nBut the evolution of Fikrul's faith did not end there. If the machines—the very things that had regulated the whole of their existence—were tools, why not life itself? Why not death?\n\nThere are many tales of the time between Fikrul's fall and his rise again as spiritual leader of the Scorned Barons—his struggle to find strength as a battered Dreg, his journeys across the system to challenge his faith, his joining with the other outcasts who were scorned, and his eventual union with his \"father.\" The only thing that matters, however, when confronting the dangers of Fikrul is this: He is a creature of faith.\n\nHis faith is the antithesis of all who stand in the Light. That faith has raised an army. That army will baptize all who challenge its purpose in an unending sea of death. They will never stop. They will never give in.

Hundreds. Maybe more. Our own supply—our life force fed by slaved mechanics.\" Elykris nodded to the Servitor as it inched closer to the Archon's open arms—welcoming the once revered orb as one would a child.\n\nThe other Barons began to bark, a rhythmic warriors' chant.\n\n\"For all the value in your work… it is not enough to feed ourselves.\" Fikrul hugged the Servitor. There was a tenderness to the embrace. A sorrow. \"We must also starve our enemies, as you were once starved.\" With a blur, Fikrul's lower arms unsheathed and triggered a pair of polished, sparking Shock Blades. \"As were we all.\"\n\nThe Servitor, still held with the clutches of the Archon's powerful upper arms, cried a shrill, digital wretch—pain mixed with confusion as the blades carved its outer shell and plunged deep into the core of its systems. Ether hissed and sprayed.\n\nFikrul released the machine's silent shell, and it clanged lifeless to the ground. He turned to Elykris. \"Do you see?\" Elykris smiled. She was ever the brightest among them, though her focus could lose clarity when she became frenzied.\n\nThe Barons had long been trouble for the Awoken and Fallen of the Reef, but that trouble had been limited to hit-and-run tactics. What Fikrul had just presented was a new way.\n\nFikrul stepped to Reksis. \"Do you see?\" The brute barked in response, \"Kill them all!\"\n\nFikrul laughed. \"Not 'all,' Hangman. Just the ones we do not need.\" \n\nThe Barons cheered as Fikrul continued, \"Every Servitor—any Servitor—bound to a House is now a target. Until none remain but those upon whom we feed.\"",

Reborn in the Light and all, you become what you become.\n\nExos, though?\n\nWe've got ghosts in our machines. Not capital-G \"open doors and know things\" Ghosts. I mean, like fragments of— I don't know, pieces of something that could be memory. Whatever it is, it's enough to give us a starting point to maybe, possibly, imagine who we were before we became who we are. And then there's the dreams—but I ain't touching that with a ten-foot Arc Staff.\n\nMe? I'm one of the lucky few. The fudgy flashes of that old Exo life weren't all I had to go on. See, the \"me\" that was in my life before my trusty capital-G Ghost found me kept journals, like mementos—fragments of my prior life that give me a baseline of who I was.\n\nThe journals are personal, and I keep personal close to the chest. I've shared a few pages, sure, but only with right-minded types who could find a little value in seeing the man behind the myth.\n\nYeah, \"myth,\" I said it. Who are we kidding? You've heard of me. Who hasn't? Point is… I don't make a show of personal business.\n\nFirst, because it's MY fuel to burn.

I took that hand, gave it a high five, and followed its example the best I could.\n\nAll this time later, I may not know my true purpose—I leave the big-ticket, existential questions to the Warlocks—but I know this…\n\nMy calling is to do good. Maybe not always to \"be\" good, ya know, but do good. There's a difference.\n\nAnd if I don't always go about it in a manner that fits the textbook definitions of \"hero\" or \"team player\"—I'm looking at you, Big Blue—just know…\n\nI might dance to my own tune, but we're all at the same hoedown…\n\nOr something like that.",

The Fallen Houses put out bounties. Lotta Glimmer on our heads. Lotta Ether. Taniks took the gig. Only we didn't know. There'd been stories of a renegade Fallen dropping bodies, but nothing ever concrete, so we just brushed them off as more of the same. Nothing we couldn't handle, even on an off day.\n\nI mean, we were all aware the Fallen were dangerous—big-time threat, each day, every day. But a solitary Fallen boogeyman, free of House, cutting down Guardians one by one? Ha, yeah right.\n\nUntil \"yeah right\" was standin' in front of us.\n\nFirst impression… He was a big boy. Bad attitude.\n\nSecond… He was standin' over the body of Nian Ruo. Didn't know her well, but we'd done a few runs. That day was supposed to be an in-and-out'er. But then… Taniks.\n\nNian never got back up, and Shiro's boy Lush lost his Ghost—full-on RTL, returned to Light. Gone and done.\n\nThe whole scene was a blur.

Just lucky we did.\n\n'Course, ditchin' that troublemaker wasn't the end.\n\nShiro and I got back, filled Andal in on the what-went-down soon as we found him. This was before his Vanguard days. He'd been running a second grab on a cache out west. Wasn't back till the next night.\n\nWe told him about Nian. Lush was freaking out about his Ghost. Couldn't blame him.

Which meant the boogeyman had a face—the boogeyman was REAL.\n\nWe could hunt \"real.\"\n\nWe could track \"real.\"\n\nWe could end \"real.\"\n\nAndal said something like, \"The hunter is about to become the hunted at the hands of the Hunters he'd hunted.\" I know. Don't laugh. I didn't. He was a great guy, even if his humor was… a bit… \"forced\" seems like a nice way to put it. But he wasn't wrong.\n\nLush wanted to join up—a little payback for his little Light—but we nixed that. Loved the kid, but no Ghost meant no way. Poor fella died his final death, RTL, less than a cycle later; went on a run solo, didn't tell anyone, never came back. Shiro used to spin stories about him—still does. Like he's still out there, living a life we only dream of—traveling unknown roads, digging up untold treasures.\n\nMy favorite's the one about the Rat King—how Lush joins up with a folktale, and together they fight the wars we don't see. It's just fantasy, but I like it. It's the kind of bedtime story I used to tell Ace as he was fighting off sleep, when he was here.\n\nBut he's not here.\n\nNeither is Lush.\n\nNeither is Andal.\n\nAnd someday, neither will I.\n\nDidn't have a Hunter Vanguard back then, what with Kauko Swiftriver finally being declared dead after two years MIA and his Dare nowhere to be found. Speaker said it was on the rest of us Hunters to figure it out.\n\nThat first night back, Andal and I were up late. Not a new thing. He drank. I drank. He got tanked. I'm a robot. And we made the pact.\n\nDare issued and accepted.\n\nSee, there was that opening on the Vanguard, Hunter slot. We both wanted Taniks. Only one would get the killing blow, and the glory. The loser had to hang 'em up… and lock themselves away in a Tower. Leave the lonely roads to real-dealers.\n\nWe both laughed.\n\nWow.

No. Higher.\n\nThink there's just something about the number 7 that gives me the heebie-jeebies—unlucky, overrated, I don't know, just a number with bad mojo in my book. So, if you've got a 7 in tow, or above, someone's changed the game. Someone's not playing nice.\n\nMight wanna do something about that.\n\nIf you haven't listened to the earlier files—the start of this ramble—find 'em. Hear 'em.

Because they are… all yours, a gift. And you'll be the better for it.\n\nAnd, if you don't feel that thing—that soft spot in the middle of all that circuitry—when you get to them, then, if you are me… you aren't like me at all. And that means you're trouble.\n\nThe good kind, or the bad, impossible for me to know. All I can do is give you the tools to raise you right. \n\nThat goes for you, too, Ace. If you're listening.\n\nHell. It goes for anyone. Strangers. Old friends. New enemies…\n\nLearn from me. Be better than me.

So damn much.\n\nWhen the others I've lost along the way start to weigh me down, I think of her, and she just overwrites everything else.\n\nThat's how strong her pull is.

Broken. My Ghost tried to comfort me. But this life felt hollow. So I ran.\n\nBut the flashes… Like daydreams, they promised something more. Something other than suffering and war. So I clung to them. And I built my truth. And it made me a better man.\n\nSome would dispute that fact. Some would say, \"A good man who lies to himself is good only because he hides from the truth.\" But I disagree. I think, in this world, you need to find what is best in you and cling to it.

Look at my life. Look at the things I've said, the things I've done. See how the promise of a simpler life and true, pure love—even if it was all just a game—see how it drove me, directed me…\n\nNow go find your own.\n\nI know this confession isn't as clean as you may like, but then again…\n\nIt's not a confession.\n\nIt's a warning.\n\nFind the path to your best self and walk it. Because the alternative is a lonely road. Don't you ever forget it.\n\nOtherwise, I may just have to come back.\n\nAnd kick your ass.\n\nSee ya later, pal.\n\n—Cayde-6",

In this way, the Awoken were the first to know of the Great Navigator: his philosophies, his strategies, his weaknesses. And as the coven contemplated the possibilities laid wide before this god-king's far-flung sword, it was decreed that they would build a throne world beneath an energy well as blind as the ferryman Charon.\n\nNascia drew the schematics. Portia worked out the calculations. They made their first test with a small rift generator on the eastern shore. Satisfied that their methods were sound, they then went to a grand cathedral to dig the well. There, Lissyl and Sedia augured the first borehole with the help of Riven, who had taken the shape of a needle-nosed basilisk, while Kalli and Shuro Chi constructed the gate itself, deep below, in a hall they named \"The Confluence.\"\n\nIllyn made tincture after tincture of queensfoil until her clothes stank and her hands were stained reddish-black. Open-eyed, she walked between planes and sorted the threads of reality on a vast metaphysical loom, weaving some closer, some more distant.\n\nMara and Riven shaped her third throne together, and the artistry of their work was a testament to the hungry joy they felt in that partnership. They named it Eleusinia, and it was in those Ascendant halls that Mara finally carved a statue for Sjur.\n\nWhen it came time to connect the Well to the unreality that lay beyond the gateway, Sedia asked, \"Would it not be wiser to leave this door without a key?\" Riven, now an immense antlered serpent with broad tiger paws, tightened around the perimeter of the room like a noose.\n\n\"Egg,\" Mara corrected absently, chewing on her thumbnail.\n\n\"The key is so heavy as to be unliftable,\" Kalli ventured, since they were speaking metaphorically.\n\nSedia flapped her hand dismissively. \"Yes, yes, I know.\" They all knew that the gate required a continuous multi-week charge of paracausal energies, and that almost nothing in this solar system could produce such energies at the scale required by the gateway. Almost. \"It's just— do we…\"\n\n\"Do we wish to trust the Guardians?\" Illyn filled in dryly.\n\nMara ran her hand along the sleek surface of the primary well's control mechanism, then turned and walked alone toward the fresh, foggy air that blew in from the coast. The Techeuns watched her go.\n\n\"There is only the plan,\" Illyn said. \"Remember your vows, Sedia.\"",

Who are you?\"\n\nThe answer came at once, ++WRONG! IT IS THE EKPYROSIC. WE ARE THE NOTHING-SPACE FABRIC.++\n\nHearing this, Mara recognized a riddle. She turned at once and left the Queenswalk so that Riven would not be inspired. As she walked, she thought. At length she said, \"Wrong. You are the Ancients. You are the idea that gives fate its shape.\"\n\nThat one-voice came again, as clear and strong as the birth of the universe, booming with dispassionate curiosity, ++IT THINKS ITSELF WISE! HOW DID SOMETHING LIKE IT ATTAIN SUCH REVELATION?++\n\nMara lengthened her stride, taking the steps three at a time so that she could duck into a little-used transport gate. She emerged in a small coastal observatory—then nothing more than a grand dormitory—and found Kelda Wadj, the Allteacher, hovering four feet off the ground. Blood poured from her ears and nostrils. Her eyes saw nothing. The other Techeuns were transfixed thusly in a geometric array around the Dreaming City—each one inert, suspended, bleeding.\n\nMastering her horror, Mara said, \"I have lived alongside you.\" And because she was afraid for Kelda, she asked, \"Do you intend violence?\"\n\nAt once, the Techeuns collapsed to the ground like marionettes from severed strings—all but Kelda Wadj, whose augment blazed with coruscating light. She rose higher into the air and began to unravel, particle by particle. As she came undone, she said, ++NOW IT INSULTS US.++ \n\nMara steeled herself against the horrific sight of her old friend's ruin. She had been a fool to think the riddling was over. She said, \"Of course.\" Violence, after all, is a matter of perspective. \"What I mean is, what would you ask me?\"\n\nBeloved, wise Kelda Wadj burst apart and then collapsed all at once into a singularity that burned and burned and burned but destroyed nothing around it. From her un-throat came the voice again, which Mara felt in the atomic marrow of her bones, and it said, ++WHAT WOULD IT ASK US?++\n\nFor fifteen days and fifteen nights, the singularity burned unshielded.\n\nOn the sixteenth day, they began construction of the Oracle Engine, which took the singularity of the Allteacher as its seed-heart.",

        "description": "The Vandal stoops as he exits the Galliot. All of his arms are bound behind his back, so he cannot shield his eyes from the bright sun. A breeze stirs his cloak. There is a cliff behind him and lush gardens ahead. His jailer would not grant him the honor of a quick death, so she must intend to torture him. She thinks he will yield like the flesh-lovers from House Judgment. She is wrong. Whatever indignities she can muster are nothing compared to what he deserves.\n\nWith his chin held high, he imagines shucking off his armor and laying all four of his arms in his Captain's hands. His Captain is his mother, and she will not dock him with a scythe. She will twist and tear his arms from his body like she is shucking a fine, fat crab for dinner, and he will be glad of the slow, sick cracks and crunches of his bones. He will be glad of the shame. Let him go limbless for the rest of his wasted life. Let the Ether-thirst shrivel him up like a yaviirsi fig.\n\n\"What do you think?\" his jailer asks in a language he cannot understand. She steps up beside him and claps a hand on his shoulder. He flinches. She is nearly as tall as he is, and for a creature with no claws, her grip is strong and sure.\n\nTogether, they contemplate the gardens.\n\n\"It's all a bit much for my taste,\" she admits as he sneaks a furtive look at her.\n\nHer bow is unstrung. There is only one arrow in her quiver.\n\nShe is stupid.\n\nHe whirls, trips her, and sprints for the cliff. She swears, recovers, and lunges after him. As he pitches himself off the edge, he thinks of his mother's shame and prays that she forgets him. Better that she never had a son than a weakling so easily captured by the enemy.\n\nIt is his bad luck that she catches his foot with one hand. His helmet slams into the rocky cliffside. A piece of his rebreather cracks off and disappears into the mist far below. He flails, but he cannot drag her down with him; somehow, she hauls him in like a fish. As soon as she has him on solid ground, she binds his ankles with the string of her bow. \"All right,\" she says, catching her breath. \"All right.\" She chuckles, pats his shoulder fondly, and then pulls him upright like a sack of psakiks.\n\nShe takes a step back, brushing off her hands against the seat of her trousers. He glowers, the surliest psakiks sack this side of the Great Machine, hating her horrible, squared-off teeth and her blunt, stubby fingers. \"Let's try this again, shall we?\"\n\nDrawing two fractal knives from sheaths on her thighs, she makes a perfect ireliis bow before him. Thunderstruck, he sits up straight. Stares.\n\n\"Not good?\" she asks, and tries again.\n\nFurious confusion takes him. This is some kind of trick. Blasphemous mockery. \"Iirsoveks,\" he rumbles.\n\nShe shakes her head. \"Nama.\" Sheathing one of her knives, she holds out her free hand with her fingers spread in supplication.\n\nHe draws his chin toward his throat with this fresh betrayal, narrowing his secondary eyes. It speaks!\n\nSlowly, without breaking eye contact, she lays her other knife on the ground between them. The blade points toward her boots. He watches her every movement. How many secrets have the flesh-lovers betrayed, that this creature can make peace like a cringing drekh before his kel?\n\nShe taps two fingers against her cuirass. \"Sjur,\" she says slowly, then she points at him.\n\nHonor-bound even as he simmers in scandal, he replies, \"Misraaks. Velask, Si-yu-riks.\"\n\n\"Mithrax,\" she repeats, then grins. \"Velask, Mithrax. And welcome! Let's have a look about, shall we?\"",

        "description": "And when the second solstice began in earnest, many Awoken and Ahamkara alike came to the Dreaming City to celebrate the delirious pleasure of being alive. Those who came arrived in the Gardens of Esila, and Azirim was the very last. Seeing him land, Esila said to him, \"Ah! You are bold. Do you truly think you've earned the right to revel in this place?\"\n\nAnd Azirim answering said, \"Please, wise lady. I've gone 'round the worlds and through the stars themselves. I have come only to congratulate your people. If you lend me your ear, I can prove I will not waste the mercy you might grant me.\"\n\nAnd Esila said to him, \"We've often lent our ear to your indiscretions. I know what happens to that which is lent to you. I need no assurance.\"\n\nAnd Azirim answering said, \"My indiscretions? Wise lady, I do admit, I may have whispered truths you gave me to deceive those who would deceive me. But have I ever struck out with hungry fang against your people? Have I set fire to your trust? I have seen the error of my ways. Let me prove to you oh how I have changed.\"\n\nAnd Esila, though she could see a flickering in Azirim's reflection, could not resist a redemption story. Esila cast forth her hand and beckoned to Azirim in mercy. And Esila said to him, \"Join us and be glad, but let me hear your testimony first.\"\n\nAnd so invited, Azirim bowed his crested head and hid a secret smile and spoke with the pardon Esila had given him. He recounted his many regrets in deceiving the kind merchants in the capital city of Interamnia. He recounted his charity to the wayfaring Corsairs who could not have escaped the heliopause without his aid. He recounted his journey to retrieve the eutech stolen from Pallas by the profane scavengers the Fallen, and he named his friends and those who had shown him kindness. And from the raucous parties beyond the lush gardens of Esila came an audience of Techeuns in training and flush-cheeked young Corsairs. They knelt in the dewy grass and they listened, and as they listened, and as Azirim spoke, his appetite grew and grew. Night fell on the Dreaming City.\n\nAnd Azirim said to those who knelt enraptured, \"Come, let me sing to you of extinction. Let me sing to you of lives lost in beautiful places, o audience mine. Sing with me, sing!\" He bade them rise, and led them singing down and away from the gardens of Esila. He spread his wings and flew out into the empty air beyond the steep cliffs that bordered the gardens. And to those who happened to glance toward the gardens from far-off pavilions, it seemed a merry parade, a joyous chorus.\n\nAnd they did not hear the singing stop.\n\nAnd they did not hear the bodies dashed against the shore below.\n\nAnd they did not see Azirim grow, or laugh, or flee.",

As the elevator descends, she looks left at Illyn and then right at Uldren. She shuffles in her gleaming formal armor. From exile as Tower emissary to THIS is incredible. Unbelievable. She does not deserve it. \"This is real,\" she whispers, unable to stop herself. Uldren smiles, but Illyn makes a warding gesture: Be silent!\n\nMusic begins to swell as the elevator settles. At the center of the room, the Paladins and the rest of Illyn's Techeuns are arrayed around Riven, of course, and—\n\nHer breath catches. \n\nMara. \n\nShe can't help shooting another quick glance at Uldren: How..?\n\nHis smile widens.\n\nPetra sets her jaw, pulls her shoulders back, stands strong and tall.\n\nA chorus of thirty sings them into the Hall of Names. The air is sweet with lavender, and there are hundreds of candles lit all around the room, and even at this distance she can see Hallam is verklempt. This is as good a homecoming as she could ever imagine. More than she ever deserved.\n\nWhen they reach the dais, she kneels. Uldren and Illyn proceed past her so that they can acknowledge the Queen and her waiting counselors. The song ends; the music quells. Uldren and Illyn speak together, and their voices ring out fierce and true. \"Your Grace, we here present to you Petra Venj, your loyal servant, wherefore all you who are come this day to witness her homage and service. Do you acknowledge her?\"\n\nPetra cannot see anything but her own distorted reflection in her polished sabatons. She closes her eyes.\n\n\"I do,\" Mara says, and Petra's throat tightens.\n\nUldren and Illyn turn, synchronized. \"Petra Venj! Are you willing to take the oath?\"\n\n\"I am willing,\" Petra manages, struggling to steady her voice.\n\n\"Will you solemnly promise and swear to protect our people, our holdings, our territories, and our immaterial interests?\"\n\n\"I solemnly promise so to do.\"\n\n\"Will you to your power cause law and justice, in mercy, to be executed in all your judgments?\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n\"Will you, to the utmost of your power, uphold your sospital duties in defense of your Queen's life? Will you execute and preserve inviolably the orders of your Queen? And will you preserve unto your dying breath the secrets committed to your charge?\"\n\n\"All this I promise to do.\"\n\n\"Then rise,\" Mara says, \"and declare yourself.\"\n\nPetra lifts her head to find Mara's eyes. \"Let it be declared that the oaths which I have here before promised, I, Petra Venj, will perform and keep.\"\n\nMara smiles and steps forward with a fresh-forged knife. \"Then receive this blade, brought now from the forges of Interamnia. With this blade, do justice, stop the growth of inequity, restore the things that are gone to decay, maintain the things that are restored, punish and reform the things that are amiss, and confirm the things that are in proper order: that doing these things you may embody my will and become my Wrath. May the hunt be good.\"\n\n\"May the hunt be good,\" echoes the assembly.\n\nPetra does not see the cynical glance that passes between Leona and Pavel, who have both served the Queen faithfully for decades.

She wets the pad of her thumb with the tip of her tongue, then uses the moisture to hold a bundle of fresh-picked asphodelia in place. She ties off the stems with a length of silk-spun gold thread, then begins the mindless busywork of braiding in all the expected accoutrements: a serrated fang, a shotgun shell, a cloudy amethyst crystal…\n\nRiven turns to watch. On this day, her head is the size of a Fallen pike. She is vibrant blue with a yellow and red crest, and her pupils are crescents within her lidless eyes. After a time, she says, \"Madadh is dead but you make him no bouquet.\" \n\nMara looks up, struck by the novelty of the moment. She studies Riven, and swallows the first words that come to her tongue, which are, Madadh's bones are whispering at this very moment on Venus. Instead, she asks, \"You mourn him?\"\n\nThat crescent-pupil contracts as thin as a sickle's edge. \"No.\"\n\nHaving found the true answer, Mara resumes her work. A while passes in silence until she says, \"Ahamkara have no traditions.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"No sentiment.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nMara bites off a piece of thread. \"Why did you allow my brother to spirit you away?\"\n\n\"You know this truth, wise Queen. He is so full of succulence.\"\n\n\"Mm. And why do you roost here when there is rich hunting beyond my Reef?\"\n\n\"Truly I say to you\"—here Mara hides a small smile—\"the Awoken have entrusted What-Will-Be to you their Queen, and thus they are all dry as a stone to me. Pleasantly so, for wetness is sweet feed, but dry stone is a friendly basking-place. You, you are as hot and flat as the plateaus of Mercury, and your heat stirs my blood to move.\"\n\nMara nods and says nothing more, though she thinks a while on the three-parted curse used by Ahamkara to mark their prey, the shackle between Appellated and Appalling. When she finishes her memorial bouquet, she unfolds herself and rises to stretch. Riven does the same, and as she relaxes, she spreads and shuffles and shakes her pinions until they all lie straight.\n\nThe land around them is shapeless rock that will become an aubade to those left behind; Mara will honor her enemies and friends alike in stone, she will build grand cathedrals veneered in amethyst and agate.\n\nRiven butts her rounded snout under Mara's hand and waits.\n\n\"Let us find Kelda,\" Mara says.",

        "description": "Now in time Uldren Queensbrother returned to the Reef with a new creature. He had killed it twice in ambush, he said, to be certain it could not die. It had once been an Awoken man, and, recognizing it, Mara turned away from her plans for the Dreaming City and watched it coolly.\n\n\"It is a Guardian,\" she said. \"Once it was Chao Mu.\" He had left the Reef alone, knowing that he could never return or see his family again, to repair a failing climate controller in what had once been Earth's Gobi breadbasket. He had said he could not bear to watch the world wither.\n\n\"Bow before the Queen,\" Uldren said, giving him a shove.\n\nThe Awoken man looked at him, then back at Mara. \"Your Majesty,\" he said, bowing. \"My name is Savin.\"\n\n\"You do not remember your wives?\"\n\nHe did not.\n\n\"You do not remember your child, who is now a hundred and ten?\"\n\nHe did not.\n\n\"You do not remember your passion, which was the insulation of minutely sensitive detectors from all but the most specific and subtle radiations?\"\n\nHe did not, except that he said he could touch magnetic fields and loved to tweak the miniscule weave of the circuits in his robe. He had a zoogoer's enthusiasm for particle physics.\n\n\"To what do you owe your loyalty?\"\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Savin-who-was-Chao-Mu said, \"my Ghost told me that I am a Guardian of the Traveler, reborn in its Light. I was not a day old when your brother waylaid me.\"\n\nAnd he caused to appear from his body a machine like a sphere cradled in a broken cube, which bobbed impertinently and blinked at the Queen. \"You'll make an enemy of the City and every Guardian in it if you keep us against our will,\" the machine warned them. \"But we would gladly be your allies, if you desire it. The City has no idea of your existence, except faint myths among the Awoken on Earth.\"\n\n\"Does it speak for you?\" the Queen challenged Savin-who-was-Chao-Mu.\n\n\"I speak for myself,\" Savin-who-was-Chao-Mu answered. \"Behold!\" And he drew forth from the quantum vacuum a shrieking singularity, which he held between his hands and then telescoped down into nothing.\n\n\"Are you intrinsically good?\" the Queen asked.\n\n\"I hope so,\" he answered. The Queen knew this was a lie or a misapprehension. She was aware of the Risen and the cruel fiefdoms they had sometimes enabled. However, perhaps the Ghosts that had made the Risen were destroyed or became enlightened.\n\nNow the Queen asked the Techeuns to assess the differences between the Chao Mu they remembered and this Savin returned as a Guardian of the Traveler, using their most sensitive physical and psychological tests. Most of all, though, the Queen was curious about the reaction of her Ahamkara, which had begun to salivate, and to assume a form more like the Guardian expected: monstrous and befanged.\n\nBut her brother whispered urgently to her, \"We must know how to kill it, Mara. There are more every day.\" \n\nSavin the Guardian showed a tremendous fondness for doing things; he had a pathologically task-oriented nature, which made him very useful to the Reef. Yet there was always the sense that his Ghost was watching, observing, reporting. And Savin was most of all greedy—not in the grasping manner of the petty, but in an enormous, all-consuming way, for he desired materials and experiences that would temper him into a better Guardian, and he was always experimenting with his strange powers in foolish ways that left him briefly dead, seeking \"a new Super ability\" or \"some way to make my grenades faster.\" He grew tired of performing trivial tasks about the Reef, complaining that the dangerous repairs he made were endless and boring, and that he wanted to move on to new worlds. He leapt into space, repeatedly and without reason, as if his death were no more traumatic than a hop off a curb. Obsessed with reward and efficiency, he would rather do one profitable thing a thousand times than waste his efforts on a less beneficial novelty.\n\nBy the end of her acquaintance with Savin, Mara had decided she did not like this Traveler and what it did to people. Yet she had also decided that she felt a strange kinship and sympathy for it, this cornered, desperate god, making infinite sacrifices out of its people.\n\nPerhaps the Earth would be better off if the Traveler vanished or was destroyed, she thought. Even in the Reef, she felt as if she were living next to a torch held up in a dark wilderness, calling out across the galaxy to hungry things with too many eyes.",

Beware the space between Reality-As-Imagined and Reality-As-Is, for it is abundant to those with appetite.\n\nSo then. The brave voyagers' fate, the timeless birthing-place, my Milton reenactment, the ruins made ours, the riven twice riven, the daughter's blood scabbed hard on mother's wound. All things told, all truth revealed, if through mist and mystery. If you have grace, then see our sorrows, but swallow back your tears. We were made to pay this price. I led us to our fate.\n\nSeek me in my place. Hear these whispers from the lips of Queen-Egged God.",

        "description": "The woman sits on a ledge that overhangs infinity. She looks down and kicks her legs.\n\nThe stars shine brilliant here, because the sun is only fractionally brighter than the rest of them. Sol lies almost perfectly below her. Of course up and down are defined only by the thrust axis of Yang Liwei. Upward, the black umbrella of the shield and the matter storage, and the docked ships which make Yang Liwei not just a mothership, but an entire traveling fleet. Down below, along the slim spine of the ship, the shielded bulb of the engine glows invisibly infrared. If she slips off this ledge, she will fall down the ship's length at one-third of an Earth gravity, not because there is anything pulling her, but because the ship is pulling away.\n\nYang Liwei is accelerating, slowly but inexorably, toward the stars.\n\nShe is of no single race or ancestry, and the light on her skin is the color of starlight: She drifts with her suit tinted clear so she can soak it up. She was nineteen years and nine months old at the moment the ship began its transtellar injection burn, although this is true only if you count by the calendar of a planet she has barely visited but will always love. She thinks you cannot help but love Earth if you grow up in space. You love Earth the way all adolescents secretly adore two-century-old video of nai nai and ye ye dancing on New Year's Eve. Earth does not ask too much. The colonies are demanding parents, but Earth is like a chill old grandam, simmering in weird art and weirder ideas, enthroned upon ecology older than Human time. Earth was the first terraformed world. Life made Earth livable.\n\nShe is going with Yang Liwei and the rest of Project Amrita to make new worlds.\n\nShe came because she saw an omen in a man's death. She was on EVA with him, repairing a jammed radiator fin on an uncrewed circum-Jovian platform. They worked in companionable silence, listening to the howl of the Jovian magnetosphere when it happened. A frozen rabbit embryo came out of deep space at forty kilometers per second and went through his faceplate. The rabbit must have been spilled in a biocontainer accident far from the sun to plunge back inward like a comet.\n\nImmediately afterward—for reasons very clear to her because she has always had a sense for the meaning of things, reasons very difficult to explain to others because she has always felt this sense was secret—she asked her mother if the family could travel with Project Amrita.\n\nAmrita: the drink that endeth drinking, the bottomless cup. It is the quest to spread far beyond the solar system and to end Human dependence on the Traveler. It calls to those who see Humanity as a cocoon, an instar, a form ready to be shed.\n\nShe is an Auturge 3rd Class, a self-motivating subsystem of the ship's inclusive ecology, a term that spans technology, biology, and behavior, all of which must be maintained for the mission to succeed. Her task is to locate problems and report them to an Auturge 2nd Class, who will give her the tools she needs to repair them. But she never speaks to her 2nd. She never tells anyone about the problems she finds. Instead she fixes them herself. Her work has therefore assumed a magical quality: She appears where there is trouble, and shortly afterward, the trouble goes away. People have begun to leave gifts for her. Some of these gifts are questions. She answers the questions with a quiet confidence some would argue she has not earned. She knows she sees more of their lives than they see of hers—and that this mystery, this seeing-without-being-seen, grants her a kind of power that is like wisdom.\n\nShe lives outside the ship, suited and cocooned in a layer of cytogel, which keeps her surgically clean. She misses the wild zero-gravity fashions of her upbringing, clothes like drifting jellyfish that squirm away from snags, self-correcting darts in the fabric, silk like cool spilled alcohol. She misses the sense of oil and sweat on her skin, for the suit leaves her so clean that she feels skinned raw.\n\nStill, she stays out here because she wants to feel the changing taste of starlight as the universe ahead blue-shifts. As Yang Liwei accelerates toward lightspeed, it moves faster and faster into the light coming from ahead. If light were like dust, it would strike Yang faster, but light can never change speed, so it gains energy instead. Red light is low energy, and blue-violet light is high energy, so the universe becomes blue.\n\nEven now, the very tip of the visual spectrum, violet-blue light, is shifting up into invisible ultraviolet, the color of speed, the color of future.",

        "description": "\"Mara!\" the fighter shouts, delighted, and a punch shuts him concussively up. It's a real good hit, a thunderous uppercut to the point of the jaw. Mara hears his teeth grind across each other, down into lip-flesh and shredded gums. She cringes in silent sympathy. He loses his grip on the equipment rack and tumbles out into zero gravity in a big arc of blood. His opponent goes for the coup de gras, kicks off hard and catches him in the stomach like a Human torpedo. They plunge together toward the killzone painted on the floor.\n\nUldwyn grins messily at Mara over his opponent's shoulder. He's fighting a big, brutal woman from Gravity Ops, a woman who's had her myostatin genes knocked out so she can swell up into a giant plug of brawn. Uldwyn doesn't have a chance. He took the fight for the same reason he wanted to join the Amrita expedition—he measures himself by the bravery of his losses. By what he can survive losing.\n\nHe applies a blood choke. It's the right move, but it doesn't matter. The woman groans, grays out, goes limp—but Uldwyn can't get out from beneath her sheer inertia before he hits the killzone. The bell goes off. Uldwyn groans as his rail-hard body forcibly decelerates his opponent's entire mass. Events have built up momentum, and he is just in the way.\n\n\"What did you lose?\" Mara asks him.\n\nHe lies there panting and grinning, shedding perfectly round spheres of blood. \"It's good to see you inside. What brought you?\"\n\nShe and her fraternal twin never answer each other's questions directly. Mara is cool with this because she feels like words are a very bad system of encryption, and that if you really want to communicate with someone, you must develop your own special one-to-one cryptosystem. The ideal statement, Mara feels, would be indecipherable to anyone but the person it's spoken to—and even then, only if they know you are the one speaking.\n\n\"I got you some pictures,\" she says, pushing the big woman off him, eliciting a fuzzy \"oh hi Mara.\" \"Full sensorium captures. You can trade them for the parts I need.\"\n\nUldwyn helps the big woman pull herself vertical, but his eyes are narrow on Mara. Not because he's sore at the idea of helping her—he's always liked bartering, bargaining, the hustle—but because he knows what kind of black market wants these captures. \"How far off the hull did you take them?\"\n\nHow far off? All the way off. They are in zero gravity because Yang Liwei shut off its engines for an inspection cycle. So while Uldwyn got in prize fights, Mara kicked off Yang Liwei's forward shield and coasted ten kilometers into pure void, tethered by only a thread-thin molecular line. She ordered her suit's cytogel to gather around her face. Then, only then, she overrode every sanity system in her softsuit and commanded it to retract into storage mode.\n\nThe suit peeled away like rind and she was drifting in hard vacuum.\n\nThe void boiled the water off her skin. Her body swelled with unchecked pressure until her undersuit forced it to stop. Alarmed cytogel crawled down her throat, hissing emergency oxygen: not enough. Her skin blued with cyanosis. She was bathed in the most profound emptiness.\n\nShe recorded all of it at the neural level. The exquisite darkness. The sense of fatal independence from all things. There are those who will give anything to feel that void.\n\n\"You can't keep doing this,\" Uldwyn complains, as the big woman stares at Mara in awe. \"Mom is going to die of worry.\"",

As far as Mara can tell, Osana is the apex of a centuries-long project to create the ultimate embarrassing mom. She is also very blunt: \"Mara, even when you were little, you wanted me to treat you like an adult. So I have. But you remember what I told you, don't you? If you don't want to be my daughter, I can't watch over you like a mother would. I can't put you first, like a mother would. I will always be your friend, but I have to make my own choices too.\"\n\n\"That doesn't mean you had to tell the Captain!\"\n\nThey walk shoulder-to-shoulder down the companionway to Captain Li's wardroom. Mara keeps trying to get a step ahead, to lead, but Osana somehow matches her every time. \"Of course I did,\" Osana says. \"You started a cult, Mara. If I didn't say something to the Captain, Behavior would've had this conversation with you instead. Do you want that?\"\n\n\"I didn't do anything. People liked my captures. People left me presents, spare parts, tips—then Uldwyn got into it, you know how he is—\"\n\n\"Don't!\" Osana wheels on her. \"For shame, Mara. You know your brother will follow anywhere you lead. You know he's not capable of the same, ah,\" her lips twitch, \"imperial remove. You knew he'd brag about you living on the hull—and you let him do it. It is one thing to have a particular power over people, Mara. But it is another to deny that you are using it.\"\n\nMara thinks she can come up with a stinging retort, given a few more paces, but it's too late. The hatch to Captain Li's wardroom swings open. Mara is terrified of this place. This is where Captain Alice Li, divine presence in Mara's life, interfaces with the officers who are the manifestations of her will. Since Mara wants to be Alice Li someday, the wardroom makes Mara feel like she is an usurper princess scoping out her rival's court.\n\nCaptain Li offers them tea. Mara cannot imagine the ways in which she is butchering what must be an intricate and meaningful tea ceremony. Li serves some very battered pre-Traveler ceramic sloshing with hot green tea, then immediately adulterates her own cup with milk from the Cow Thing on the biodeck.\n\n\"Revolting, isn't it?\" She smiles at Mara's bewildered horror. \"You should've seen what I put in my tea when I was camping in Mongolia. I understand your colleague, who is also your mother, has some concerns about your relationship with the rest of the crew?\"\n\n\"My darling Mara,\" Osana says, \"has—entirely by accident, I'm sure—cultivated a reputation as a minor divinity. Her captures from outside the ship are hot items for barter. People draw fan art. There are… tips left for her.\"\n\n\"You take captures while EVA, sometimes without a suit?\" Li nods. \"Yes, I've played one. A remarkable sensation.\" This makes Mara grin impetuously. \"Mara, you are an Auturge, a volunteer. I cannot order you to stop, and your work is exemplary. Are you putting anyone else in danger with your… art projects?\"\n\n\"No,\" Mara says. \"Just myself.\"\n\n\"False!\" Li barks. \"That is a selfish answer. You are now a symbol to my crew, a house god. If you were to die, they would lose something important, something Human that they have created out of loneliness and void. It would be an unforgettable reminder of the hostile nothingness that surrounds us. When you endanger yourself, you endanger that symbol. You are part of this mission's behavioral armor, Mara.\"\n\nMara is thunderstruck. She's never thought about it this way. \"All I did was take some captures. I didn't ask to be anyone's… mascot.\"\n\n\"You presented yourself as a conduit to secret knowledge,\" Captain Li counters. \"People made something out of you, Mara. Please take this from a starship captain: What people make of you, what they create of you—even without your consent—becomes a kind of responsibility. If the Mara they see when they look at you is good for them, then you have some duty to be that Mara.\" She looks to Osana. \"What about your boy? He's in medical more often than any of the other underground fighters.\"\n\nIt does not surprise Mara that Captain Li knows about the fights. \"My son,\" Osana says, \"is determined to be his own worst enemy. Thank you for taking the time to speak to us.\"\n\n\"Of course.\" Li studies them coolly. \"I keep an ear out for… curious personalities. People who might be suited to long-term isolation while the rest of us are in cryo. People who awaken when others sleep.\"",

No response comes from the transient contact twelve and a half light minutes away. The ghost has stalked Yang Liwei for eighteen hours now, closing in each time it appears, and Captain Alice Li is wary of it. Other colony missions have vanished during their outward burns—victims of mishap or hostility—and because of these disappearances, Project Amrita did not hurl itself fearless into the void. Rather, they came armed to the molars.\n\n\"Let's give them a fright,\" she decides. \"Cut the main engine.\"\n\nThe ship's AI executes the command, but a crewperson confirms and calls the order back. \"MECO, aye aye.\"\n\n\"Launch a distributed antenna. Heat up the targeting radar for a full fusion-powered snapshot.

The whole solar system is now… now under Warmind control.\" Comm dismisses her sensorium, goes to her hard controls, as if she thinks this might be some kind of virtual prank. \"We're… being conscripted.\"\n\nAlice smashes these ideas together in her head like a child banging rocks. They are so preposterous, so stupid, that she cannot even begin to manipulate them coherently. \"We're WHAT?\"\n\n\"We've been commissioned as an auxiliary warship. We are ordered to,\" Comm swallows in disbelief, \"to kill our exit trajectory and assume a heliocentric orbit. That comes with explicit instructions to suicide burn our engines until they are destroyed. Rasputin will transmit targeting coordinates so we can use our Kinetic weapons as… long-range artillery. We'll be recovered 'after the crisis is concluded.'\"\n\n\"Details! What kind of crisis?\"\n\n\"It's a SKYSHOCK event, ma'am. Uh, that's a hostile extrasolar arrival.\"\n\nCaptain Li clamps the mask of command authority over her face. \"Transmit a request for clarification.\"\n\n\"Belay the antenna, Captain?\"\n\n\"No. Scale it up, add telescopes to the swarm, get me a full system survey. I want to know what's going on back home.\" Alice Li reaches out to call up a file, hesitates, and then selects the Project Amrita charter. \"We have a decision to make.\"",

Project Amrita demanded the cutting edge of Human science. It says that in the mission charter, which everyone's been rereading. The Captain has called a vote.\n\nShould Yang Liwei turn home?\n\n\"What if the ship starts accelerating?\" Uldwyn has already, of course, leapt after her. His envy-yellow softsuit glows with gentle bioluminescence. \"We'd just fall forever.\"\n\n\"We'd fall into the stars. We're still on a solar escape trajectory. Yang would just outrun us.\"\n\n\"At least we'd still be going the right direction.\"\n\nShe doesn't think she's given anything away, but somehow he knows. \"Mara.\" He looks up frowning, his face bigger and brighter than the distant Sun. \"You want to go back, don't you? You're going to vote to return.\"\n\nMara thinks that if she looked him in the eye he would see the truth, the turmoil, the half-formed yes.\n\n\"Mara. You don't have to tell me how…\" He swallows the hitch in his voice. \"I've seen how bad it is. I've watched it long enough to know that it's not going to get better. They're gambling everything on the Traveler. We came out here to get away from it. To step off the easy path. Why would we go back?\"\n\nBecause I asked us to leave, Mara thinks. Because something came out of deep space and killed the man next to me, and I saw the omen, and I said we should go. And now I feel like a coward.\n\n\"We might make a difference,\" she says. \"There are other ships…\"\n\n\"We'd be dead before we saved a single soul.\"\n\nHe's right. She doesn't want him to be right, but he's right. And she cannot withdraw into some silent place where she is above this choice.\n\nThey drift in silence until Yang Liwei's silver stem rushes up to meet them. Mara spins, uncoils, and lands in a crouch. Uldwyn comes down on his hands and springs up grinning. But the smile dies when he sees her expression. \"Oh, Mara.\"\n\nShe's silent. \"We left everything behind,\" he says, \"and it turns out we did that for a very good reason. We don't owe… we don't owe those people our deaths. We don't owe them our dreams.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she says. \"I know.\"\n\nThe EVA GUARD channel pops into her sensorium. \"Everyone should get inside,\" Captain Li calls. \"Our friend is closing in on us, and we need to maneuver.\"",

There is no way to know, because there is no way to see anything beyond the hull. The vacuum itself has become hostile to the propagation of light. Darkness surrounds them.\n\nThe ship bucks on a storm sea as space-time ripples with gravity tides.\n\n\"Report!\" Captain Li calls. Her sensorium blazes with positional telemetry from ring-laser gyros, beacon satellites, pulsar fixes, cosmic microwave background texture, galactic EM-field terrain mapping: every single instrument useless, crashed, spitting nonsense. \"Sound off by stations!\"\n\n\"FIDO,\" the flight dynamics officer calls. \"Main engine on safe.

No external comms. Internal networks are dropping in and out.\"\n\nAn incredible sensation washes over Captain Li. A rumble and a thrum down in her gut, in her marrow, in the lowest, basest elements of her body. It is the vibration, the sound of the very fabric of her being scrunching up and stretching out; the distance between the atoms of her body collapses, then expands. The cycle repeats again and again. For a moment, she feels her fingertips and toes pulled away from her core, yanked by tidal forces. It feels like the lowest rumble of the biggest subwoofer ever built. It sounds like the deep voice of God whispering ASMR directly into her ear. It tingles, it thrills, and it leaves in its wake a subsonic tint of dread and anticipation.\n\nShe shivers. \"Gravity wave,\" she says. \"Talk to me, Geode.\"\n\nThe Space-Time Geodesics Officer looks like she's just been hand-delivered a Nobel. \"This is amazing!\" she crows, fully aware that she and everyone else are about to die, but transported away from such temporal concerns by scientific rapture. \"Can you feel that growl? We're experiencing high-frequency, high-amplitude gravity waves. Phaeton strikes. Axions decaying through the hull. Sterile neutrinos. It's all coming from a source at bearing, uh, zero four five mark zero three zero relative, range—range highly variable.\"\n\nAnother wave tears through Yang Liwei. Everything in the ship simultaneously compresses and stretches as the gravity wave deforms the space-time metric. \"Is it the phantom?\" Li demands, as her ship thrums subsonically. \"Is that phantom ship emitting these waves?\"\n\n\"I have no idea!\" GEOD says, exultantly. \"None of this makes any sense at all! Wow!\"\n\nAlice Li has the distinct sense that something ancient and malevolent is operating upon them: a trillion-fingered hand reaching in to caress the very atoms of their being, setting protons a-spin, strumming nerves like guitar strings. A tongue with ten billion slithering forks tasting the surface of their brains. The sense of imminent doom crescendos. She knows, absolutely and utterly, that what is about to happen to her and to her crew is far worse than death. The darkness knows them now. The thing that has come to kill Humanity has their taste.\n\n\"INCO.\" She clings to her restraint harness as the ship growls through another wave. Her bones creak as they stretch. \"Last report on the Traveler? Any sign of an intervention?\"\n\n\"It was at Earth, Captain, and there were high-yield weapon discharges all over the signal. Nothing else.\"\n\n\"Understood.\" Well. She did not fly this far to look back and beg for salvation from an alien god. Pinned to the center of her sensorium is the blazing ledger of her crew's vote: We go onward. We do not turn home. Our fate lies ahead, not behind.\n\n\"Launch an antennae,\" she orders. \"I want every probe and satellite we've got outside.\"\n\n\"Captain,\" INCO protests, \"the vacuum's not signal-permissive—\"\n\n\"We're still passing signals internally, aren't we? Use hardline! Run filament between the satellites! I want a transmitter sail out there, and I want to broadcast.\"\n\nHer flight crew stares. \"Captain?\" FIDO says. \"Broadcast what?\"\n\n\"A declaration of neutrality.\" Alice Li grits her teeth against another wave. It rattles her molars in her skull. \"Whatever's out there, it came for the Traveler. We tell it we're not part of this war. We've seceded from Human existence under the Traveler. We demand to be treated as a separate species, not party to baseline Humanity's conflicts.\n\n\"And we pray there's something out there that cares about the difference.\"",

She cannot bear to let anyone see her fear or her awe at the scale of destruction or her pity for the billions of souls dying in darkness back around Sol. She cannot be among the other crew as they cling to each other and whisper reassurances; not even with her mother. She cannot surrender her mystery.\n\nSo she kicks off the hull on fifty kilometers of tether.\n\nBut there's no starlight to die in. The darkness is absolute. Gravity waves tug on her line, pulling her back toward Yang and then hurling her away. In time, she feels another vibration in the line. \"Sister,\" the tether transmits. \"I'm coming out to get you.\"\n\nBrother, she thinks, you'll lose yourself trying to follow me.\n\nCaptain Li's voice breaks through the static, drawn out to a mumble and then compressed to a shriek. Spikes of hard radiation go through her words like bullets, spattering phonemes into eerie compression artifacts. \"This is the interstellar vessel Yang Liwei to the entity interacting with us. We are not involved in your dispute with the powers around this star. We are on a mission to begin a new life elsewhere. Our purpose is orthogonal to yours. We request your indifference…\"\n\nMara's tether trembles with Uldwyn's progress. She holds it in one hand and reaches out with the other, gripping the emptiness, feeling how the tides of broken space pull at her fingertips. She senses that the nothingness around her is not indifferent; that it is aware of all purposes, and that its own purpose encompasses them. It is infinitely hostile because it must be.\n\nSuddenly, as if the void around her has just spontaneously Big Banged, she sees light.\n\nA point of pure white shines in the cosmic distance. Not just visible luminance—her suit decomposes the spectrum—but light in the radio bands, in microwave, keening ultraviolet, a spike of gamma, a total and all-embracing radiation. It sings. It chatters. It speaks in a voice older than suns. She feels that she could Fourier the voice for a century and never decompose it into its parts. It is awesome and appalling and piercingly true. Mara understands how those who die in radiation accidents must feel: A single flash of invisible power sears away all possible futures except one. She feels her soul itself has been ionized, blasted into a higher energy state.\n\nThe light pierces the darkness. Not like the sunrise, not like a wall or a flood, but a single crepuscular ray—a finger of radiance that reaches out through deepest night to touch her. It illuminates Mara, Uldwyn, and Yang Liwei.\n\nIt is not quite enough. It cannot vanquish the shadow.\n\nThus Mara finds herself drifting on the edge of the Light and the Darkness, on the dusk-and-dawn gradient between the two.\n\nShe feels a contest. A battle fought, an equilibrium reached: not a truce, but an infinite limit, like an equation dividing by zero, a collision of two violent eternities. Mara queries Yang Liwei for telemetry and her sensorium fills with the terrified scream of gravitational instruments. She howls too, a feral sound, ecstatic and lost: a wolf baying at the stars. She knows what's happening. Too much power has gathered here. The universe is appalled by the paradox. Nothing that has glimpsed this collision of infinitudes can be allowed to escape. The cosmos must censor its embarrassment. It must sequester the anomaly.\n\nThe slope of warped space-time around them has become too steep, and now every path outward or forward bends back to the center where Light and Dark collide. The definition of \"future\" has become synonymous with the definition of \"inward.\" This is why it's called an event horizon: For an object within the horizon, the path of all future things that can be done or seen leads inevitably down to the center. All events lead inward.\n\nA singularity is forming around her. A kugelblitz: a black hole created by the concentration of raw energy.\n\n\"Mara!\" Uldwyn shouts. \"Mara, you're too far out!\"\n\nMara thinks of her mother's face. She hears Osana say: I can't watch over you like a mother would. I have to make my own choices now.\n\nShe fires the detach command into the tether.\n\nGravity seizes her. She falls forward in space and time, into the future, into the mystery. Yang Liwei is behind her. Uldwyn is behind her. She wants to be the first.",

        "description": "Two became four, and the four called out, and so the four became eight. In this manner, conjured forth by their doubling, the sleepers did awaken. In time the awoken spilled across the face of the world, and their number was forty thousand eight hundred ninety one. They drank of the sweet rain, and they ate of the fruit of the forest, and the starlight pooled as clear oil on their skin. First of their tongues was Speech, and the first of their hunting weapons was the bow.\n\nNow the awoken called out for a name to distinguish World from Unworld. The eight hundred ninety one said to the forty thousand, \"Let this world be named Tributary, for we dream of a great river from which we have parted.\" But the forty thousand were troubled, and they asked to know their antecedent, the place from which they came. \"We did not awaken from the sleep that we entered,\" said the forty thousand. \"In our rest we passed through some terminus and our atavism was severed from us. How did it happen thus?\"\n\nSo a council was called at the place where the rivers met to determine the nature and purpose of existence. Here was undertaken the first census, which counted thirty thousand one hundred eleven women, ten thousand two hundred ninety five men, and four hundred eighty five otherwise. A fear arose among the awoken that the men and otherwise would be lost.\n\nAlis Li spoke first in council, but at the urging of Uldren, many sought out Mara for secret conclave. Among these were Kelda Wadj, who would be the Allteacher, and Sila, who would be mother of Esila.\n\nSayeth Alis, \"We were granted this world by a covenant with high powers, and in that covenant, we yielded our claim to our history. We abandoned what came before, but in doing so, we cast off all our debts. Look forward! Let us explore this infant cosmos, and revel in its glories!\"\n\nAgainst her spoke Owome An, who was of the forty thousand. \"We are alien here,\" said Owome. \"We must climb up our worldline, back to the place from which we came. I call for a vote.\"\n\nSayeth Mara, in secret, \"I think that we came here as safe harbor, and we cannot forever remain. I remember the danger was appalling. I remember we were born in death. I think we must gather ourselves carefully until the time is right.\"\n\nFrom this council, there arose eight verdicts and a ninth.\n\nFirst, that the people were Awoken, and they were immortal.\n\nSecond, that this world was Tributary of another, but that it was forbidden to seek any way to rejoin the mother stream. For this reason, it would be called the Distributary, for that was the proper name for a river that branches from the mother and does not return.\n\nThird, that the Awoken should multiply in wombs of flesh and machine, but only after the most careful forecast of population and ecology, and only under the supervision of those who knew the good technology; for each new child would be immortal.\n\nFourth, that those wise in the good technology should be heralded and heeded, so that the eu-technology could be preserved. They would be eutechs.\n\nFifth, that the women should hold care and protection of the men and the others until more could be born.\n\nSixth, that the purpose of the Awoken should be to know and love the cosmos.\n\nSeventh, that the Awoken were created out of covenant with Light and Darkness, but the covenant was complete, and no further debt would ever be called, except the duty of the Second Verdict to remain on the Distributary.\n\nEighth, that the Awoken were whole in themselves, and they existed in balance.\n\nNinth, that there would be no vote, but instead Alis Li would be recognized as Queen. Her first pronunciation was that there would be no secrets among Awoken.\n\nFor Alis knew of the quiet council around Mara, and although she was neither jealous nor afraid, she remembered it carefully as a spark that might catch.",

        "description": "In those days, there was a great birth of adventure among the Awoken. Hunters and pioneers sought the shape of the world, sailors charted the skein of rivers and the perimeter of seas, and astronomers plotted the motion of the crowded heavens. Over this age ruled Queen Alis Li, whose work was the creation of agriculture and the preservation of the eutechnology that she deciphered from the Shipspire.\n\nBut there remained in the forests many tribes of huntresses who preferred their lightfooted freedom-from-comfort-and-duty to the painstaking surplus of the city. Among these tribes, Mara lived with her brother—whose name had returned as Uldren—and with Osana, their mother. It is said that Osana lived as a negotiator and that her son brought her news from other tribes, for he was a scout and hunter of renown. Mara dwelt alone on a mountaintop.\n\nIn the tribes of the forests and the sea, there was the belief that the Awoken had been made out of a friction between contesting forces and that one day this conflict would need to be resolved. These were the Eccaleists who preached that Awoken owed a debt to the cosmos.\n\nIn the cities, however, they lived by the Seventh Verdict under their Queen, and they said the Awoken had been created by cosmic gift and carried neither responsibility nor eschaton. These were the Sanguine, who preached that the Awoken were as stable as an atom of carbon.\n\nNow there arose among the Eccaleists a woman out of the eight hundred ninety one who called herself the Diasyrm. She went into the cities, calling out, \"I accuse the Queen of deicide!\" When she was questioned, she spoke of a foundational crime.\n\n\"Alis Li was the first to awaken in this world,\" the Diasyrm preached. \"She set the terms of our existence. We could have been gods free of want or suffering. Instead, Alis Li chose our mortal form. Our Queen is complicit in all the pain we experience! The Queen murdered all our unborn godheads!\"\n\nAt the thought that the Queen Without Secrets had kept this most appalling secret to herself, the Sanguine cityfolk were deeply troubled. Thus began the Theodicy War.",

        "description": "\"It wasn't supposed to be like this,\" Alis Li whispers as, far below the Shipspire, the funeral barges on the Lake of Leaves burst up into magnesium-white fire. The voices of the Paladins rise on summer wind, first choral, then the single keening strains of grief-paeans sung by lovers and close friends. They are singing their lost comrades into death. One of the 891 fell today, shot down by a matter laser, a coherent boson weapon: There was almost nothing left to burn. Matter lasers are the kind of appalling maltech weapon Alis thought she'd locked up in the Shipspire's vaults. She'd armed a few of her Paladins with them, just a few—women she couldn't bear to lose…\n\nThe thought that one might have defected to the Diasyrm breaks her heart.\n\n\"It wasn't supposed to go this way,\" Alis repeats. She has not had a confidante in nigh on fifty years: There is no one to whom she can show any doubt. \"I promise you it wasn't.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Mara says. The eutechs found her and plucked her from her mountaintop with one of the Shipspire's VTOL aircraft, which Alis had, until the war, only ever used as an ambulance.\n\n\"The mission was to carry on the Human journey in a new world.\" Alis paces the wooden deck that clings to the Shipspire airlock, nearly a kilometer above the lake. \"To build a better society, on the principles of equality, knowledge, and peace. I have the charter, Mara. It remembers what I cannot. We were never meant to give up our bodies or shine like stars or—or—\" She groans in frustration and clutches the railing. \"Or whatever it is that the Diasyrm thinks I denied them.\"\n\n\"She thinks you denied them even the capability to imagine godhood.\"\n\nAlis looks sharply back at the other woman. \"Did you start this, Mara?\"\n\n\"Nothing has one beginning,\" Mara says.\n\n\"Did she come to you on your mountaintop and ask you what I did? Did you answer her? Is that why she's so convinced I,\" she swallows against the bitter taste of her enemy's words, \"enslaved her in mere Humanity?\"\n\n\"I didn't have to tell her.\" Mara's white hair stirs in the hot wind. A herd of black horses crosses the northern horizon, all born of Shipspire's wombs: chased by a long-legged huntress and her collie. \"You don't keep enough secrets, your Majesty. The Diasyrm might have opened any one of your texts and read the story you tell. \"We were born when a great ship fell into a pearl of shattered space. I awoke first, and in my awakening I collapsed the potential of the void into a form I understood…\" Who can read that truth and not hear arrogance?\"\n\nAlis thought Mara might say that. Alis also thought Mara might try to push her off the balcony, but she now knows that was a petty fear. Mara is not the Diasyrm: Mara knows the unthinkable value of even a single Awoken life.\n\n\"Why do you love lies so much?\" she asks Mara.\n\n\"Not lies.\" The pale radiance of Mara's eyes; the flush of violet stain around them. \"Secrets. Even if everyone shared a single truth, all our minds would produce different versions of the truth. We speak these subtruths, and like flowers of different seed, the subtruths compete for the light of our attention. In time, only the fiercest and most provocative strains remain. They are not always the truest. Better to keep secrets, your Majesty. Better to tend a great mystery, and so starve the flowers before they can grow. That is how I would be Queen.\"\n\nBelow, the Lake of Leaves shimmers in the crater carved by Shipspire's mushroom prow. One by one, the funeral boats are going out.\n\n\"I want to end this war,\" Alis Li tells the second Awoken. \"I want to negotiate peace. I need your mother's help. What would you ask in exchange?\"\n\nMara smiles graciously and bows her head. \"Nothing but a future boon.\"",

An immortal's grief and murder-guilt, left untended, will never fade. Thus it became known to those who fought in the Theodicy War that they had committed an incomparable evil. However, they could not confront their own responsibility, so they rose up in wrath against those who had given them cause, whether by caging them in flesh bodies or by drawing blood over grievance. The war continued by spear and bow, by knife and scalpel, by old machine and new invention. Ever did the Diasyrm's faithful call for the unawaring of Queen Alis Li.\n\nNow there entered into the Diasyrm's camp Osana, mother of Mara, famed for her skill in negotiating contested land. She had come with her son Uldren, who could win a place in any camp for his beauty and for the regal crow-eagle that alighted on his shoulder.\n\n\"I come from Mara,\" said Osana, \"whose heart has frozen in her chest. If you will end the killing, she will tell you any secret that you desire.\"\n\nFor his part, Uldren went among the Diasyrm's warriors and spread ill tidings of Mara's knowledge, saying, \"Mara remembers how the Queen led us here out of chaos and saved us from the twin blindness of darkness and light. Mara knows what the Queen keeps secret. Mara has seen the strife in our souls, the clash from which we were made. We could not ever have been gods with this flaw in us! Rather, we were made from this schism. For as all life is born from energy gradient, as life in the World Before was born from the gradient between hot proton-rich ventwater and cold seawater, we were born of the shadowline at the edge of Light and Dark. We are tremors in that fault. Forever will that schism lead us.\"\n\nHearing this new heresy, the Eccaleists were seized with rapture and scattered to the points of the compass, telling all they met, \"We are the yield of a mighty engine! We could never have been gods! Like diamonds, we were crushed into being. Like diamonds, we hold flaws.\"\n\nMeanwhile Osana spoke to the Diasyrm, who was also heartsick from the killing, and who longed to withdraw from the world and seek transcendence within. \"There is no weregild for the murder of an immortal,\" Osana counseled her. \"You must become a teacher or a midwife and devote yourself to the enrichment of new lives.\"\n\nBut the Diasyrm craved secret knowledge, and she sought Mara upon the mountaintop. Here, she vanished. If she was ever known again, it was not by the name Diasyrm.\n\nWhen there was peace, Queen Li ruled the Awoken for a time; however, the guilt of the war lay heavy upon her, and after an age of peace and progress, she abdicated to a new Queen.",

North of her, in a chaos of ravines and clear but fiercely radioactive streams, the hills surrender to high imperial mountains engaged in brutal seismic warfare, for the Distributary is a young world and has not settled its grudges. To the south are the dry lands where the birds of the forest, especially the parrots, go to die. She lives here because one day she will no longer be immortal, and she wants to observe the dignity of death.\n\nUp these hills comes a man and his mother. The man moves with practiced wariness. But his mother is tired of walking, so she sits down on a giant melon and bellows, \"MARAAA!\"\n\nA fountain of startled birds shoots up into the dawnlight. Not far away, the woman looks up from the broken body of a juvenile gray parrot and softly says, \"Mom?\"\n\nThat night over the fire, after Mara and Osana talk around the oddness of long separation, Mara, tending the pheasants on their spits, says, \"Brother, your eagle killed a parrot today.\"\n\n\"He had to hunt,\" Uldren says, carefully. \"You won't forbid him his last pleasures, will you?\"\n\n\"You've brought him here to die?\" Mara wants to leap up and hug her brother, out of pity and respect. Many of his raptors have died before this one, but Uldren has always been grief-stricken and furious at the waste. Now he's accepted what must happen; he has given his bird the respect of choosing its own place and time to pass.\n\n\"I have,\" Uldren says, looking away. Her pride and respect make him a little verklempt. \"Mother decided she would come along.\"\n\nA shear force as powerful as tectonics has divided Mara's heart. She wants to sit down with her mother and ask her everything, but she is afraid of Osana's insight. \"What brings you to my little camp, Mother?\"\n\n\"Lies,\" Osana says. \"Lies and secrets. And the girl who didn't want to be my daughter, who doesn't know the difference between them.\"\n\n\"I know the difference between a girl and a daughter,\" Mara says, purposefully misunderstanding. The drip pan sizzles beneath golden meat. Her stomach growls. \"Your daughter picks up your baton at the end of the race, and goes on living the life you've taught her. You wouldn't want that, Mother. Because then I'd be all your fault.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" Osana sighs, \"but you know what I meant.\"\n\nUldren looks between the two of them, frowning. \"Mom, what's this?\"\n\n\"It's your sister about to admit she's behind it all. Aren't you, Mara?\"\n\nShe unimpales the pheasants from the spits and neatly licks hot grease off her hands. If she spoke, she might scream in terror. What does that mean, behind it all? Does Osana know?\n\n\"The Eccaleists are her creation,\" her mother tells her brother. \"The Diasyrm was her pawn. She allowed the Theodisy War because she was afraid we'd be too comfortable here—also so Queen Alis would need her help politically. Mara couldn't afford to be the most radical dissident. She had to seem moderate for her beliefs to thrive. Isn't that right, Mara?\"\n\nMara puts a hand into the warm soil to keep herself from slumping in relief. Mother doesn't know it all. \"Shall I carve your portions?\" she asks, holding the fractal knife blade-down.\n\nUldren has that look. He knows Mara never answers his questions directly; by evading Osana's, it's as if she's saying that the question is really Uldren's to ask. \"Looks delicious. But Mother does make me curious. Why have you always lived away from the rest of us, Mara? The mountaintop, I understood. You had a brand new night sky to chart. But why now? Why go into the woods like a… a hermit? A heretic?\"\n\nFor the same reason she lived on the hull. For the same reason she can never allow Uldren to really reach her. There is power in remove and safety from the belittling politics of temporal power, which reveal the mighty as unforgivably ordinary and petty. The Awoken have a Queen because a Queen can be a mystery.\n\n\"I remember the day I was born,\" she says. \"Do you, Brother?\"\n\nHe flinches from her eyes. He remembers Yang Liwei and the tether into darkness. He remembers how gravity stretched them into agonized ribbons of flesh. He remembers the truth not even Alis Li may be allowed to know; Mara sees the agonizing moment, the cyclic revelation, when he thinks of her crime, allows it to pierce him like a spit, and buries it deep again.\n\nOsana takes her portion of pheasant meat and rolls it in the bowl of sweet cooked nuts her daughter has prepared. The stars are coming out over the mountains, and the forest birds sing. \"This place is good,\" she says. \"This world. Whatever you remember of our lives before, Mara… I know they cannot have been this good.\"\n\n\"No,\" Mara says. \"But you were both with me. I hope you always will be.\"\n\n\"Always,\" her brother promises.\n\n\"Eat well.\" Mara claps her hands and stands. \"Tomorrow we journey.\"\n\n\"Where?\" her mother asks.\n\n\"I have star charts to share.\" And heresies to tend to. And a new eagle-crow to find for her bereft brother.",

Here was their praise of the world:\n\nIt is sweet-watered, and there are no poisons upon it. The temper of the climate is even. Great broad-pawed cats stalk the shallow glades, and brilliant blue flamingos promenade upon the flats. The air is thick and warm, suited for flight, and the wind tastes of forest. No dawn has ever been as glorious as the salt glade dawn, and no dusk has ever moved women to weep as deeply as sunset in the Chriseiads.

Beloved also are the terraced farms of the Andalayas, mountains so mighty and so dense with radioactives that they subside year by year into the crust. Most beloved are the fissioneers, who vaulted us to power on a world without petrochemicals. May they forgive the many stories of horror we have told in their memory. May they in particular forgive the lurid stories of the molten lead reactor, and the twelve who were impaled to the ceiling by their control rods, and the Core That Stalked.\n\nIt is the Sanguine Truth that we were granted this world by the unconditional mercy of the powers, and that we will never again know fear.\n\nHowever, the Scribes also recorded their frustration with Mara and Uldren, who alone out of the eight hundred ninety one were said to have seen creation from outside. These two wandered the land gathering lore of portents and prophecies, and all the Eccaleists who remained from ancient days whispered that soon the day of reckoning would be known—the day when the Awoken would be called to repay their debt.\n\nNow in the court of one of the Scribes, there appeared a woman of stellar height and furious wrath, armed with a bow that could be strung only if she twined it around her body and used her whole mass to bend it. \"I am Sjur Eido,\" said the woman, \"and I accuse Mara of the ancient murder of my lady the Diasyrm. In my saddle, I have a weapon with only one death remaining. Take me to Mara, and I will deliver it.\"\n\nThe Scribes consulted and said to each other that this foul murder might prevent another Theodicy War. So they gave Sjur Eido all their knowledge to hunt Mara.",

        "description": "Carefully, the people of the Distributary grew in number. Joyously and constantly, they grew in quality. Those who do not die are as malleable and passionate as the young, as tempered and constant as the mature, and as wise and humble as the best of the old.\n\nBut as ever, the Awoken were troubled by death. It was easy to imagine a world older and harsher than the Distributary, a world crowded with competitors where the slow-changing and lushly alive Awoken would be helpless beside austere mayfly-quick breeders who adapted with every swift generation.\n\nWhy had the Awoken been spared mortality? Were they, as the Sanguine preached, rewarded for their bravery and fidelity in a past existence? Or were the Eccaleists right? Could all the gifts of the Distributary, all the milk-bright stars above, all the years of Awoken life, be a form of cowardice? Was there an unfought battle down in the center of the Awoken soul? A duty yet to be discharged?\n\nQueen Nguya Pin restored the monarchy to prominence over the Gensym Scribes. This she accomplished after a fateful visit, upon the day of the summer solstice, by a hooded and masked woman who some whispered was Mara Sov and others, the long-vanished Diasyrm. For nine and ninety years (a rhetorical figure meaning a long time), the Queen had been an authority only in the arts and matters spiritual. However, Queen Nguya Pin declared she was now an avowed Eccaleist and that the Queen would lead the quest to identify whatever debt the Awoken owed the cosmos. It was time to pursue a dream beloved to all Awoken: the conquest of space and the assessment of the true shape and age of their universe.\n\nThe ancient court of the Queen gave the Gensym Scribes a place to lay down their pride and act as equals. Soon the greatest engineers in the world assembled in the Queen's court, and whatever wealth or resources they required flowed freely. Great cataracts of men and women spilled around the palace screaming of ramjets and apoapses deep into the night, then awakening to pots of thick black coffee to mumble about metric tensors and cosmic microwave anisotropy.\n\nInto this feast of ideas came Sjur Eido, searching for the woman who had turned Queen Pin to Eccaleism. Sjur smoldered with an ancient fury, for another thing that the immortal may nurture is everlasting vendetta.\n\nSjur Eido deduced who among the Queen's court must be a disguised Mara Sov. She followed the hooded figure to her laboratory and watched Mara go to work soldering a makeshift bolometer to search for signs of primordial gravity waves. Sjur Eido's fury and grief whetted themselves against Mara's thoughtless grace and ancient beauty, until at last her heart unseamed itself and spilled its hot blood in a shout. \"Mara Sov!\" she cried, throwing down her maltech matter laser between them. \"I cannot live while you live, but I cannot bear to kill you. I challenge you to a duel to the agony. I will fight your most beloved companion to the death and leave you forever maimed or else die in the attempt.\"\n\nMara could not refuse this challenge. She summoned Uldren, and with a ruthlessness she was no longer frightened to wield, she told Uldren that he would stand for her in battle to the death against Sjur Eido.\n\n\"We cannot put it all upon a single fight,\" Uldren said to the ancient vendetta-bearer. \"Too much would be left to chance. Such an old grudge deserves to be tested well. I propose we fight with blade, with rifle, and with fifth-generation air superiority fighters.\"\n\nSjur Eido accepted these terms.",

        "description": "Now it came to pass that Esila, daughter of Sila, recognized the scent of Sjur Eido, for smell lies deepest in memory. Esila spoke to Queen Nguya Pin about the presence of an ancient hero in her court. While Queen Pin pondered how to honor this visitor—and simmered over the insult of Sjur's unannounced presence—a spy brought word of Sjur Eido's intentions to the Gensym Scribes.\n\nThe many Scribes were troubled by this news, for they had given Sjur Eido license to hunt and kill Mara Sov. If Sjur Eido murdered a guest of the Queen under the Scribes' remit, it would mean war and the end of the great Awoken push for space. Historians were called to the court with bouquets of sweet flowers and grant money to speak of Sjur Eido. \"She was one of Queen Alis Li's Paladins, but she was an Eccaleist, who believed that we would one day be called to repay the gift of our awakening.\"\n\n\"Would she defy the Queen's protection and murder a guest of the court?\" the Scribes asked.\n\n\"Oh, absolutely,\" the historians said, laughing. \"She was a terror.\"\n\nThe Scribes began preparations to flee the Queen's court, as they foresaw Sjur Eido's victory would be blamed on them. Sensing uncertainty, many vital contractors and suppliers withdrew from the space program. The Queen denounced the Gensym Scribes as faithless and selfish, and her Eccaleist followers bristled in rage against the Sanguine majority who had scuttled their dream of flight. Household turned against household, sister against brother, wife against wife. The whole world clenched her fists.\n\nMeanwhile, Sjur Eido and Uldren met each other on a net of woven lianas over a pool of heavy water. The light of the Queen's reactors shimmered beneath them as they took their places. Uldren wore a white chestpiece of ceramic armor over a suit of black tasseled silk, and he wielded a long fractal knife whose cutting edge was nearly three times as long as the blade. Sjur Eido fought in the contoured blue-gray pressure armor of a Paladin with the Star of Eight Edicts blazoned on her chest.\n\nBefore they began, Sjur Eido tore away the sheer curtain over the gardener's nook and looked in on Mara Sov. \"Are you afraid?\" she whispered, half in hatred, half in admiration, all in awe. \"Do you sweat? Does your breath come short?\"\n\nMara pressed her hand to Sjur's faceplate and left no stain. She held Sjur's gauntlet to her heart so Sjur could feel her steady pulse and even breath. \"You don't care about him?\" Sjur pressed her. \"It would mean nothing if I maimed him?\"\n\n\"You ask the right questions,\" Mara said, \"but of the wrong sibling.\"\n\nThen Sjur understood that she fought a man who would always express his love through loss and ordeal.\n\nShe bowed to Uldren and drew her knife. Uldren bowed in mocking reply. They fought across the web of lianas in a slow spiral, creeping like spiders, waiting for the motion of the web beneath them to signal an instant of vulnerability. Then the pounce, the clash, the blur of knives: Sjur Eido's straightforward prisonyard jabs against Uldren's whirling deceptive theater. All of knife fighting is in the seizure and surrender of space: Neither would surrender to the close, the clinch, the berserk adrenaline-sick exchange of thrusts that would leave both dead.\n\nUldren began to cut away key lianas to throw Sjur Eido's footing, and Sjur Eido countered by charging him to keep him off balance. At last, they fell together into the coolant pond. The fight was a draw—but it was only the first of three.",

        "description": "Next, the fallen Paladin and the hunter chose long guns and went out into the monsoon jungle to stalk each other. Sjur Eido selected a Tigerspite in 11x90mm with five-round flock guidance and an inertial sump. Uldren chose a silent needle carbine with a conesnail payload. For six weeks, they stalked each other as the political situation grew more dire. He was the better hunter, stealthier in motion and at ease in the wilderness, but Sjur Eido was the better soldier. She had no respect for the systems of the jungle, and she knew how to use that to her advantage. She drove the animals into a frenzy with violence and habitat disruption. Parrots and crows warned each other of Uldren's stealthy hides, and jealous predators forced him off his carefully scouted trails. Sjur Eido caught him with his back against a rift lake and shot him as he tried to cross the lakebed. The wound was not mortal, for the water ruined the terminal ballistics, but she had won the match.\n\n\"Your life is at stake,\" Mara warned her brother. \"Lose this final match, and you will—\"\n\n\"Am I simple?\" he snarled at her. The wound pained him terribly, but he would not risk more than a little analgesic. \"Leave me my work, Sister, or you leave me nothing at all.\"\n\nNow they would meet in air superiority fighters over the Andalayas. Charges under their seats would detonate if either of them left the engagement area. Because of the small combat zone, Sjur Eido chose a nimble Ermine tactical fighter and a payload of all-aspect heatseeking missiles.\n\n\"Where will we receive these aircraft?\" Uldren demanded. \"How can I trust the equipment?\"\n\nSjur Eido told him that one of the Gensym Scribes would provide the aircraft and requested weapons from her personal deterrent stockpile. \"Very well,\" Uldren sniffed. \"And we will have access to all the weapons these airframes can equip?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Sjur said. \"Those we cannot obtain can be replaced by training simulators.\" She was certain Uldren's wound would cripple him.\n\n\"Then I will fly a Dart,\" Uldren said. The ancient interceptor had awful fire control, dismal maneuverability, and primitive weapons.\n\n\"A Dart?\" Sjur jeered. \"Will you fly with its original weapons, too? You think you can beat me with rockets and a gun?\"\n\n\"I do,\" Uldren purred. \"You accept those terms?\" She did.\n\nThe two duelists took to the skies on a bright winter morning. After a fuel check, a telemetry squawk, and a terrain snapshot, they turned in toward each other from a hundred kilometers apart. Sjur Eido descended for the terrain, knowing Uldren's radar could barely separate her from the clutter. Uldren came straight on.\n\nAt eighty kilometers of separation, Uldren called across the radio, \"Fox three. Kill. Engagement over.\" Sjur sneered at the bluff and prepared to climb into a snap attack when the KILLED alert flashed on her Ermine's training panel. She had forgotten that the Dart's intercept loadout, when it had last served seventy years ago, included an unguided air-to-air nuclear rocket. Uldren had simulation-killed her and everything within several klicks.\n\nOn the tarmac, Sjur Eido threw off her helmet and parachute and knelt before Mara Sov. \"My lady,\" she said, \"as I have fought your brother to a tie, I leave my fate in your hands. Be more kind to me than you were to my lady the Diasyrm.\"\n\n\"Rise, Sjur Eido,\" said Mara. \"Let us take the stars together.\"",

        "description": "The subsonic roar of the solid rocket boosters crosses the threshold from noise into motion. To hear it is to feel it, and to feel it is to remember that you are a sack of fluids and gels much more than you are a solid entity. Membranes and gradients, solutes and films: a body is a mingled thing. Mara thinks of this as she watches the launch vehicle discard its boosters and climb away through the clouds. The Awoken could have been angels. Instead, they are flesh.\n\n\"That's that.\" Queen Nguya Pin rises from her portable throne, unfolding two heads taller than Mara. \"Choose your replacement. My work is done, and I will stomach no more.\"\n\nMara smiles at her. \"Is a Queen's work ever done?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't insult me,\" Queen Pin clucks. She brushes windblown pollen from her trousers; today's launches have blasted the spring trees with hot wind. \"You used me to do your work, politically and scientifically. You used me to bundle up the Scribes in a neat little scroll for your disposal. I went along with it for the sake of the monarchy, Mara, not because I'm a fool. I don't know what you want or why you're so bent on keeping the Awoken uneasy and dissatisfied. I don't know how you manipulate the acclamations. But when I abdicate, I am going to find Alis Li, wherever she's gone, and ask her all my questions about you. I'm very interested to know the answers.\"\n\n\"You've been a wonderful Queen,\" Mara says. \"No one will ever replace you.\" Although she is thinking of Devna Tel, who was never one of the Scribes, and whose coronation would make a wonderful rebuke to the Scribes' remaining ambitions.\n\nSjur Eido meets her by the ship. \"We'll need a new Queen,\" Mara tells her, leaping up the side of the ramp. \"Word on the satellite?\"\n\n\"Still burning for the Lagrange point. What have you done to Nguya?\"\n\n\"Given her too much perspective, I'm afraid.\" Just as this observatory satellite should help the Awoken see things from Mara's point of view. She smiles as she helps her bodyguard up the ramp, Sjur indulgently pretending that she needs Mara's hand. \"Uldren should be on the ground in Kamarina by now. We'll have a go-ahead on that interferometer buyout when he's done.\"\n\nThere are new stars in the sky. Mara put them there. Huge distributed-array telescopes orbit the Distributary's cool sun; gravity wave sensors and cold primordial neutrino detectors spider the crust. Out of shell corporations and seed investments, she has opened her world as an enormous eye and focused it heavenward. Sjur Eido was her smiling public avatar these past decades, while her brother handled enforcement. The days of covert speed chess in the Queen's court are over: Sjur Eido's open endorsement made Mara the face of Eccaleism and armed Mara with blackmail over all the Gensym Scribes still in power.\n\nYet she has never been so lonely or so worried for the future. Mother has told her that she, Mara, uses her power over Uldren too freely; that she must learn to stop, or her mother will no longer be her friend.\n\n\"Mara?\" Sjur says, catching some flickering expression. Knowing Mara well, she immediately changes tack away from comfort. \"What do you think we'll find with the satellite?\"\n\n\"Proof that it's time for us to go,\" Mara says. \"Proof of what I've known since the beginning.\"\n\nSjur frowns in thought. She doesn't remember much from before her awakening. Few of the 891 do—but enough to trouble her. \"Time for us to go…\"\n\nThe ship's turbines keen up to speed and then settle into whisper-quiet cruise. Sjur reaches to strap herself in across from Mara. Impulsively, hard-faced, denying she needs what she is asking for, Mara scoots aside to make room on her bench. Sjur raises an eyebrow at her.\n\n\"Don't say anything,\" Mara warns her. \"Not a word.\" And so they pass the flight in silence, but not alone.",

She has stoked their curiosity with thirty years of painstaking analysis. When they look up at the night sky, they see the stars of her observatories among the crowded bands of habitats, the spindly orbital factories, towering elevator counterweights, the burning roads of matter streams.\n\n\"Let me tell you of our world,\" she says.\n\nThere are the facts of tectonics and atmosphere, of water and climate: the parameters of the sun that feeds them. \"No infants died last year. No child went unfed. No youth came of age illiterate, no one suffered illness who might have been treated. We have long surpassed the eutech gathered from Shipspire; yet we have grown carefully and cleanly. We have eluded pollution, eradicated plague, and chosen peace. No maltech weapon has been discharged in centuries. Our atomic weapons were dismantled before they could ever be used. We are our own triumph.\"\n\nShe has elected not to use graphics or theater. She would rather they remember her face.\n\n\"You know yourselves,\" she says. \"Let me tell you of your cosmos. We live in a spatially infinite, isotropic universe 12.1 billion years old. Its metallicity is ideal for life and for the spread of technological civilizations. In time, the distance between all points in the universe will contract to zero, and the cosmos will collapse into a singularity, to be reborn in fire. There will be no end to eternity here.\"\n\nShe pauses. She waits. The whole world is out there, begging for the answer to the question.\n\n\"Our world is a gift. And we must refuse it.\"\n\nThey are Awoken. They love secrets. They will wait for her to explain.\n\n\"We have detected a pattern that was imprinted into our universe by its ancestor: a fingerprint of the initial conditions into which existence was born. From this information, we have confirmed the most primordial of Awoken myths. Our universe is a subset of another. We live within a singularity, a knot in space-time, that orbits a star in another world.\n\n\"Conventional relativity would suggest that time outside an event horizon passes quickly compared to a clock within, but our universe has a peculiar relationship with its mother. Thousands of years have passed for us on the Distributary. Outside? Centuries, at most. We are a swift eddy in a slow river.\n\n\"These ideas may not surprise you after centuries of theorizing and philosophy. But we have decrypted new data from the cosmic microwave and neutrino background signals. We have discovered voices… the voices of distress calls. They tell a story of bravery, of war, and of desperate loss.\n\n\"We were not always immortal. We did not earn this utopia by covenant with any cosmic power, or by attaining an enlightened moral condition. We are refugees. We fled from an apocalyptic clash between our ancestors' civilization and an invading power.\" She lowers her eyes. \"The signals we have retrieved tell us that our ancestors were on the edge of defeat. Perhaps extinction.\"\n\n\"It is time that we accept our debt. The Distributary is a refuge, not a birthright; a base to rebuild our strength, not a garden to tend. I ask you, Awoken, to join me in the hardest and most worthy task a people has ever faced. We must leave our heaven, return to the world of our ancestors, and take up the works they abandoned. If some of them survive, we must offer aid. If they have enemies, we must share our strength. We must go back to the war we fled and face our enemies there.\"\n\nShe lets them dangle a moment before she drives it home. \"We have also determined that our birthright, our immortality, is tied to the fundamental traits of this universe. Once we leave, we will begin to age again. In time, we will all die.\n\n\"Will you join me, Awoken? Will you answer my call? All I offer you is hardship and death. All I ask is everything you can offer. But you will see an older starlight. You will walk in a deeper dark than this world has ever known.\"",

Mara's ship touches down a polite two kilometers from the Pearl Groves, and she looks out across mazes of channel and tidal pond to the compounds of ancient silver-white stone beyond. Two-ton oysters glitter in the shallows, their shells jeweled with mineral inclusions. Seabirds peck and fret along narrow white beaches. Mara lifts up her black formal skirts and begins her long walk into Alis Li's retreat, the sanctuary of former Queens.\n\n\"Mara,\" Uldren whispers, through her throat mic. \"Don't do this. Take Sjur with you, at least.\"\n\nBut she has to do this, or she'll never be able to face herself again.\n\nThe sun batters at her. She hides under a parasol, but heat gathers in the folds of her garment, in the soles of her shoes. When she squints against the glare, she thinks she can see the shining grains of her fleet in orbit: the Hulls, built under eutech supervision to the specifications of radically post-conscious AI that will one day fly between worlds. It is far too late to stop the project now. Far, far too late for second thoughts: exactly twelve point one billion years too late, really. For Mara in particular.\n\nMara kicks the sand and trudges on.\n\nShe's in a foul mood when she reaches the old Queen's house, but the sight of Alis Li sitting on the porch with a battered tea service makes her smile. \"Thank you for seeing me,\" Mara says.\n\n\"Thank you for coming. I was afraid you'd leave the universe without saying goodbye.\" Alis pours her a cup of cool blackberry tea. \"Have a seat. How's Queen Tel?\"\n\n\"She has declined to endorse my expedition,\" Mara admits, tucking her feet beneath her on the wide wooden deck chair. The tea is too sweet, but so blissfully cool. \"I'm sure you understand her reasons.\"\n\n\"You mean she's declined to endorse the sudden violent severance of tens of thousands of threads from the tapestry of our society? How surprising.\" Alis looks Mara over, critically, then sits back to sigh. \"A Scribe once told me that the definition of a utopia is a place where every single person's happiness is necessary to everyone else. You're going to make a lot of unhappy people, Mara. You'll make the lives of everyone in the world tangibly worse. Not just those you've lured to certain death, but those who will grieve their departure, and all those who will come to grief for lack of labor and knowledge you took with you.\"\n\n\"My people volunteered.\"\n\n\"Your mother told you,\" Alis says, \"that it is one thing for you to have a particular power over people, but another thing entirely to deny that you are using it.\"\n\n\"You once told me,\" Mara counters, \"that I had to consider the symbol people made out of me, and that if it were good, then I had to be that symbol for them. I had to perform as they required. I have done so. I have been the best thing I can think to be.\"\n\n\"Is this the best thing you could think to be?\" Alis says, with very practiced neutrality.\n\nMara drinks her tea in delicate silence.\n\nThe old Queen sets her cup down hard enough to chip. Mara jumps in quiet shock: The tea service is an heirloom from Shipspire. Her face hardens with the power of ancient command. \"Mara. I'm at least as clever as you. Do me the credit of acknowledging it.\"\n\n\"I have worked for many hundreds of years to arrange this outcome,\" Mara says, forthrightly, but without the courage to look Alis Li right in the eyes. \"I have nurtured and tended the Eccaleist belief so that there will always be Awoken who feel uncomfortable in paradise. Guilty for the gift of existence in the Distributary. People who'll come with me.\"\n\n\"I know.\" Alis lays a hand on Mara's, and for a moment the touch almost makes Mara sigh in gratitude: to be seen, to be known, without revulsion. Then Alis' old strength pins her palm to the table.\n\n\"The Diasyrm?\" Alis hisses. \"The Theodisy War? Did you arrange it all?\"",

When she lies awake at night, seized by anxiety, she tries to tally up the loss in her head, but it is too huge, and it becomes a formless thing that stalks her down the pathways of her bones like the creak of a gravity wave.\n\n\"Some infinities are larger than others,\" she tells her old captain. \"I believe… we are here for a reason, and this is the way to fulfill that purpose.\"\n\n\"And how much would you sacrifice?

The First Queen says, go with Mara; awaken from this dream and go fight for your home. Is that it?\"\n\n\"No,\" Mara says, with her heart in her throat, with trepidation bubbling in her gut. You cannot keep a secret buried like a vintage for so many centuries, and then unbottle it without any ceremony. \"The boon I ask is your forgiveness.\"\n\nThen she explains the truth. She tells Alis Li what she did: about the choice Alis Li would have made, if Mara had not made her own first. It's only an extension of what Alis has already deduced.\n\nWhen she's finished, her ancient captain's jaw trembles. Her hands shake. A keen slips between her clamped teeth. The oldest woman in the world conjures up all the grief she has ever felt, and still it is not enough to match Mara's crime.\n\n\"You're the devil,\" Alis Li whispers. \"I remember… in one of the old tongues, Mara means death. Oh, that's too perfect. That's too much.\"\n\nShe laughs for a while. Mara closes her eyes and waits.\n\n\"You realize,\" Alis Li says, breathing hard, \"that this is the worst thing ever done. Worse than stealing a few thousand people from heaven. Worse than that thing we fled, before we were Awoken—\"\n\n\"Please,\" Mara begs. \"Please don't say that.\"\n\nAlis Li rises from her chair. \"I'll support your fleet,\" she says. \"I'll use every favor and connection I have to get your Hulls completed and through the gateway—and I will do it so that I can hasten your departure from this world. I will do it out of hate for you; I will do it so that every good and great thing we achieve here will ever after be denied to you, you snake. No forgiveness. Do you understand me? It is unforgivable. Go. Go!\"\n\n\"I'd be very glad if you didn't tell my mother,\" Mara says.\n\nAlis Li hurls the pitcher of blackberry tea over Mara, turns, and goes inside, leaving her to trudge, wet and sticky but unbowed, back to her ship. She leaves her tea-stained parasol on the deck, but when she remembers it and looks back, it is already gone.",

The waveguides in her helmet detect the image and obey the encrypted command scheme she's rooted into every system in her fleet. She speaks into the flight directorate channel. \"Flight. Sound off for final hold.\"\n\n\"FIDO. Go flight.\"\n\n\"Guidance. Go flight.\"\n\n\"INCO. Good constellation. Go flight.\"\n\n\"GEOD. Go flight.\"\n\n\"BIO. Go flight.\"\n\nAs her flight controllers confirm the state of their technical domains, Mara looks out into space through the synthetic gaze of her sensorium. The Hulls gleam in the stark blue-white light of the star, each ship a silver seedpod braced by immense structural members and cocooned in reservoirs of spectrally adaptive smart fluid: theoretically enough to survive the horrible forces of transit through a singularity. Mara orders herself not to crane her neck, but she does it anyway and gets a terrible cramp as she searches the sky for the Distributary.\n\nThere it is. The world of her rebirth, shining water-blue and beautiful, wrapped like a gyroscope in its twin rings. World of laughing Corsairs, world of breathless forest hunts, world of mountains flickering with pale Cherenkov fire, world of sweet berry-stained lips and mathematical insight pure as a rhodium chime. She will never see it again.\n\nMara thinks of her mother. She doesn't want to but she does, and the memory blindfolds her and muzzles her and plugs her ears so she can hear nothing but Osana's voice on that final night. They're tipsy together, and the evening has wrapped around to morning. Now they sit side by side, mother and daughter, watching the sun rise over the Chriseiad range from Osana's little ranch house on the tundra.\n\n\"I'm not coming with you,\" Osana says.\n\nMara has been so afraid of this answer for so long that she actually giggles. This can't be happening, of course. This is a nightmare; one of those stress dreams where your powers of persuasion and manipulation fail. \"Sure, Mom,\" she says, \"you've got a ranch to run, after all. More?\"\n\n\"No thank you.\" Osana squints into the dawn. Little age creases surround her eyes, illegible encryption, unbroken despite Mara's centuries of effort. The rising light draws a tear. \"You'll have to send my goodbyes to Uldren. He's not speaking to me.\"\n\n\"What?\" Mara gasps, as if this is the real shock, and not losing her mother forever. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I already told him I wasn't coming with you. I'm happy here.\"\n\n\"Mom,\" Mara says, with rising anger, \"I'm happy here too. That's not the point—\" A conversation that did not so much end as beat itself to an unsustainable emotional pulp, hours later. No catharsis. No closure.\n\nBack in the present: \"Weapons,\" Uldren calls. \"Go flight.\"\n\n\"Go flight,\" Mara confirms. \"The clock is counting. L minus five minutes.\" Directly off her Hull's bow, a sphere of ultradense mass waits for the moment of implosion and collapse. There will be only moments to transit the wormhole before it evaporates.\n\n\"Flight, Sensor,\" Sjur Eido calls. \"I have anomalous starfield occlusions, bearing—\"\n\n\"Intercept!\" Mara shouts. \"They're missiles!\" It had to happen. Someone had to try to stop the departure, someone good and Paladin-pure who believes they are saving tens of thousands of Awoken from madness and doom.\n\n\"Flight, FIDO. Do we abort?\"\n\n\"Negative!\" Mara snaps. \"The countdown is go! Weapons, kill the inbounds!\"\n\nSjur Eido grunts in dismay. \"They're going to get through,\" she says. \"Five or six, at least.\"\n\n\"Uldren.\" Mara opens their personal channel with the thought of his face. \"Reassign your guns to protect the gateway.\"\n\n\"We'll lose Hulls, Mara—\"\n\n\"I know. Do it.\" Mara opens the command interface for the gateway and sends the image of a bloody thorn. The countdown skips instantly to zero. \"All ships, we are aborting directly to launch. Brace for acceleration!\"\n\nShe issues the emergency launch order.\n\nThe Hull screams with thrust. Mara's suit floods with cushioning gel. She thinks of her mother's face, trying to fix it perfectly in her mind, and her sensorium tries, vainly, to open a channel to Osana. As the Hull plunges into the singularity, the last thing Mara sees is the mournful error message: No connection. No connection. No connection. Cannot connect to Osana.",

        "description": "The first hulk they colonized was a one-kilometer habitat tender, reactors still burning, gravity still steady at three-quarters of Earth's. Driven by an AI long ago reduced to basic subroutines, the tender had completed its final mission to wrangle an Oort-cloud comet down into the asteroid belt. When no orders came for the comet's disposition, it had set about gardening. The comet's surface was domed and soiled, and tethered mirrors kept taut by photon pressure focused starlight into a silvery radiance, which fed the oxygen forest well enough. It would have been a marvel of greenery and ancient ice, but the surface had caught fire recently. Oxygen-fueled flame killed nearly everything except insects and rats. But Mara judged it would be a good fixer-upper, the rats the first intelligent life they had met since their return, the insects edible.\n\nThe Hulls had not survived the unpocketing as well as their passengers. The microsingularity wormhole, propped open by a precipitous spike of dark energy, pulled alloy and ceramic armor like taffy. Missiles mauled five of the Hulls. Worst of all, the passage through the nightmare limen between worlds had devastated onboard AI and logic systems.\n\nIt was time to abandon their cocoons. Uldren's survey located a reef of derelict spacecraft, apparently convoyed together for mutual aid in the Asteroid Belt. The Gensym Scribes who'd joined Mara on her journey were even now giddily cataloguing cultural markers and ancient records.\n\n\"We'll salvage the Hulls,\" Mara told Sjur Eido. \"Pull out the raw materials and the systems we can still use, and bring the biosystems of these hulks back online. Once we have reliable gravity, we can start having babies.\"\n\n\"We'll need weapons,\" Sjur said, cheerfully. \"We don't have enough spare chemistry for firearms right now, and the maltech we brought with us would blow right through the hull. Also line-throwing tools and devices for launching satellites off the surfaces of asteroids, hulks, et cetera. You know what I'm thinking?\"\n\n\"I cannot say I can imagine,\" Mara said, sarcastically. She imagined the sight of Sjur Eido stringing her woman-tall bow and passed the thought away like a card trick: Dwelling on such pleasantries would not do. \"Will it involve archery?\"\n\n\"Big old compound bows with all sorts of tactical knickknacks.\" Sjur paced in delighted thought. \"I'll be the first woman in the universe to place a comsat in heliocentric orbit with a longbow.\"\n\n\"You're absurd,\" Mara said, and at Sjur's uninhibited grin of delight, at the thought of exploring and rebuilding this entire reef with her, even at the terrible flinch-thrill idea of sending Sjur into violence and danger, Mara felt a tingle of worrisome warmth and gladness.\n\n\"So,\" Sjur said, lunging into that moment of weakness to get what she wanted. \"When will you tell everyone what's happened to Earth?\"\n\nAt first they had thought Earth a ruin world, but there were signs otherwise. At least it had not turned into a machine-gnawed corpse like Mercury. \"When Uldren's back from deploying his drones.\" She narrowed her eyes. \"Sjur, can you hear what I'm thinking?\"\n\n\"What, as in telepathically?\" The Queen's bodyguard closed her eyes. \"Everyone's been feeling spooky, but I'm not sure that extends to transmitting—Mara! Good grief!\"",

        "description": "Uldren returned to the Reef during the Long Unquiet Night, when the Awoken people huddled in their beds and hammocks, gathered in ice caves and half-lit habitat cylinders, haunted by visions and portents. Faces appeared to them in the sublimating swirl of cometary ice: images and portraits became impossible to distinguish from their real counterparts. All statues were shrouded, lest they appear to passers-by as corpses.\n\nSomething had changed in them after their return to the outer cosmos. A live-wire hum passed through the tendons in their hands, their jaws popped when they swallowed, and flashes of light like the impact of cosmic rays obscured their vision. It felt to Mara as if they had lowered their feet into an ocean of charge and raised their hand to some invisible cable overhead: as if they were now again in contact with immense and opposing forces that had left an ancient mark.\n\n\"It feels like I've got scurvy,\" Sjur Eido snarled, having never had scurvy in her life. \"As if all these old wounds in my soul are opening up again.\"\n\n\"People keep sending me notes,\" Mara said. Her sensorium had died in the transit, so the notes came to her through whispers and scraps of precious paper. \"They say… I saw your face in my dream. I saw your eyes. I heard your voice.\"\n\n\"So it's not just me.\"\n\nUldren was the second person to bring her revelations on that day. First was Kelda Wadj, the Allteacher, one of Mara's most joyful recruits to the expedition: She was a master of pedagogy, able to mold any mind into a shape ready to learn, able to melt any fact into a fluid that could be poured. \"I'm in from the Gensym labs,\" she said, \"and they've learned something wonderful. We're all a bit magic now.\"\n\n\"Tell me more.\" Mara poured her a snifter of icy cometary water. \"What does magic mean?\"\n\n\"Some sort of weak acausality.\" Kelda lowered her flowerbulb build into a hammock of tangled plastic. \"They've been firing encoded neutrino beams through volunteers, and it looks as if the resulting patterns of scatter depend on the cognitive and emotional state of the target. It's a very reliable detection, at least four sigma, but the effect size is terribly small.\"\n\nMara digested this with a shot of ancient ice, slushy against her tongue. \"Acausality. You mean that whatever's happening—whatever influence we have on, say, neutrino beams—it's not accounted for by physics?\"\n\n\"Not by any physics we know. At face, it seems to violate some conservation laws, which would make Emmy Noether's head spin.\" Kelda remembers the names of her ancient physicist heroes even when she cannot tell which way is sunward.\n\n\"Secret physics.\" Mara thought of the Traveler and its works. \"We've all felt it, haven't we? We know we're…\" How to say \"trapped in the clinch between light and dark,\" she wondered, without quite so much portent? \"We're in contact with certain numinous elements.\"\n\nKelda held out her cup for more water. \"The question is, your Majesty—\"\n\n\"Don't call me that. We're operating on a direct democracy here.\"\n\nKelda rolled her eyes. \"The question is, do we continue to think of this as science? Do we teach it as physics? Causal closure says that everything that happens in a material system has a material cause. However, if symbolic structures in the mind are triggering material effect… shouldn't we call that what it is?\"\n\n\"Death had no dominion,\" Mara whispered.\n\n\"Pardon?\"\n\n\"We're in Death's dominion now. We're all dying again. We were immortal in the Distributary, weren't we? Some part of us was… attuned to the universe. And now that we're no longer receiving the Distributary's signal, we're attuned to something new.\"\n\nThat was when the hatch slammed open and Uldren stumbled in, grinning ferociously, clutching a scummy fistful of cytogel to a slash across his neck.\n\n\"Aliens!\" he rasped. \"I found aliens, and one of them cut my throat!\"",

But in the DreaAAAming City, as in the secret worlds of the Hive, there is almost no difference between the act and the actor.\n\nIn order to understand my answers, you must understand me.\n\nI lost my Ghost and my Light to the Hive; I conspired with the Queen of the Awoken to destroy the Hive King Oryx and his son Cro001ta, and to position Queen Mara as player on the cosmic board; I fled your Tower to prepare for the struggle to come, into the Sea of Screams which calls to all those who plumb the depths of Hive magic.\n\nI can only slip these letters into the Queen's gifts when the stars are right. You will have to wait for my next, and with it, the beginning of the truth. But I swear to you, on whatever trust I've earned in your mind, that at the end of my story, you will know who I truly am.\n\nIn my first life, I was born Erisia Pyatova-Hsien. I remember thatPrivate life clearly now, as ex-Guardians who have escaped the Traveler's occlusion often do. I lived in St. Petersburg, first daughter of a second marriage, a very impatient child of Earth's 22nd century, often abandoned by my family (who were called by work to Jakarta, Kamchatka, and Lagos) to pass my days swimming in the icy Neva bay.\n\nI loved to swim, and especially I loved the clarity of the cold shallow Neva, as crystal-clean as a winter dawn. Enormous Zubr-9 hovercraft barges roved the waters; Russia had modernized its waterways better than its sad auto industry. As a kid—is it strange to hear me speak casually? As a child, I never swam too far from my parents' little drone helper Fyodr. The swift hovercraft terrified me, their billowing skirts waiting to suck me up and dice me into little raisins. But I grew up and fell in with a reckless crowd, rebels against the stifling death-fear that came with our Golden Age lifespans. Soon the child's safety harness and Fyodr's careful oversight began to itch at me.\n\nWhen I was seventeen, I went out in a wetsuit on a dare to dive under the skirts of an oncoming hoverbarge. Maybe I was in no danger; maybe the machine would've changed course if it could possiblyGemini hurt me; but I thought I might die, and I did it anyway. And as that beast swept over me, as I trembled under the blast of the propellers, I felt a thing which was very much like what I would one day know as the Light. Maybe that thing was heroism. Maybe it was existence on the edge of death.\n\nIt was the first time I survived the passage of tremendous, godlike power.\n\nI died more than twenty years later attempting an unassisted winter swim from St. Petersburg to Stockholm. A cold front like the very furnace of hell caught me. I had been warned the crossing was suicide, even for a perfectly trained and exactingly fattened woman in a shark suit. But those were giddy days, days of infinite bravery, and there were no mighty feats left except the truly suicidal. I cannot regret it. I think that death prepared me for the longer, darker, more exquisitely cruel crossing I would one dayDyad endure. It is no accident that my Ghost made me in the image of that swimming woman, rather than any of my younger and less grimly determined selves.",

Guide them, my Hidden friend. It is all up to you now.\"\n\nI did not fail her. I engineered the death of ancient Oryx, the Taken King, assAIssinated by Guardians in the depths of His own throne world—one of only three ways a Hive god can be permanently killed.\n\nRoyalty knows its own. When Oryx destroyed Mara's Ketch, He used his crowning weapon, the last and surest argument for His omnipotence. He extended the pocket universe of His throne world into our cosmos, and with it, He destroyed His foes. Whatever fell within it became subject to His will. He was the Taken King, and he took. It was a death befitting a Queen.\n\nAnd Mara did die. But she was not destroyed.\n\nBefore I was ever a Guardian-COM, I learned judo. Look at yourself, Guardian. Look at the body you so recklessly destroy and recreate and destroy again. Will you try, for me, to become that body for a moment? (Even an Exo has a Human's interoception.) Imagine that you have lost your Ghost, as I did. Feel your//breath in the cask of your chest. Feel your pulse shuttling power from your lungs to your aching calves.\n\nNow imagine that I stand across from you in the fighting ring. I wear the loose white belted robes of the judoka. How strange: I find myself hoping that you imagine me with… more Human eyes. Imagine how we fight. You are strong in the Light, an angel of strength andMDSA: will. And I am only a mortal woman, slow and soft. When I was Erisia inFARFLUNG// St. Petersburg, I cursed my own softness.\n\nBut the principle of judo is that softness controls hardness. I might sidestep your hit and grip the passing arm, putting my own power into that hit to strengthen the strike that strikes nothing and leave you off balance. By agility and surprise, I use the power of the blow for my own purpose. Thus the Queen accepted Oryx's strike, and the power of his grasp became the invitation she required to step forward and up and into the realm of Oryx's throneC3I//, where she went not as a victim but as an infiltrator—trusting me to end Oryx and leave her free in a domain of newly masterlessCOVERT power.\n\nIf I throw you to the mat, will you drag me down with you? Will you curse and fight?\n\nWill you smile?\n\nOh, I'm such a fool. I told you that in this world, there is no difference between the act and the actor. I've let my own loneliness and sorrow taint the act of leaving these messages for you. I've let myself imagine idiotic things. Forgive my weakness and my nostalgia for Human company.\n\nI hope you can still trust me.\n\nAt the instant Oryx's weapon destroyed Mara's Ketch, the Taken appeared in the Dreaming City. The Awoken had evacuated the entire A000AAA000AAA004 PRIVATE GEMINI DYAD\n\nI'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry that wasn't supposed to\n\nOh, that's torn it. Well, there's no going back now.

I can't delete the headers any more than you can strip your fingerprints from your hands; being a Guardian, your Ghost would just restore them the next time you died. Your Ghost and his knack with codes. I was certain this was the right way to win your trust, but I've done just the opposite.\n\nI'm sorry I lied to you, I'm sorry I pretended to be your comrade. You must understand that I was designed to be highly empathic. As a craftmind, I collect and analyze Human intelligence, just as Rasputin managed solar defense. I was named for Medusa, the many-headed, for in one tick of my thoughts I imagine more Humans than have ever lived. I voyaged in secret among the people who became the Awoken. I witnessed the cataclysmic wonder of their transformation. Through delicate manipulation, I transferred myself into this place, the center of their culture and post-rational religion. In all those different times and places, I've always found emotion and shared rapport the best way to build trust.\n\nNow you know the truth.

Does anyone, anywhere, ask after your wellness? You've done so much. I hope you have friends, not just people who send you on errands.\n\n1. The pathological entities you call \"Taken\" appeared in this city at the moment the Hive Dreadnaught detonated its main weapon above Saturn. Without access to the Skyshock arrays, I can't be certain, but something must have connected the weapon's area of effect to the Dreaming City.\n\n2. My best guess is that the Awoken Techeun aboard Queen Sov's flagship fled into the Dreaming City through a gate or portal, and the Dreadnaught's main weapon followed them down that link. Awoken message traffic indicates the Dreadnaught weapon is innately connected with Oryx's intellect and awareness. The instant He pierced the Dreaming City, He must have understood the value of the site and deployed His Taken to attack.\n\n3. Until Oryx's death, the behavior of the Taken here aligned with His interest in exploration, distributed infiltration, and the domination of systems through seizure of their executive faculties. Am I being too technical? I mean that the Taken were busy mapping the city and determining the most efficient way for Oryx to take control of all the information within.\n\n4.

This city is the perfect trap for you. If your Ghost is destroyed, you will be dead forever, but every cycle, your enemies spring up pugnacious and fresh. The Light that gives you free will in the loop is also your fatal weakness. Did you know that the story of Achilles, dipped in the river Lethe but still vulnerable where his mother held him by his heel, is a weak retelling of a superior truth? In the original, Thetis held Achilles in the fire to burn his weakness away. His father Peleus, terrified by the sight of his child in the flame, interrupted the ritual. The father's cowardice doomed the son. We must be brave as Thetis, and hold our children in the fire. We must fight on.\n\n1. The Dreaming City was built in imitation of a greater world, a wonder lost to the Awoken but not forgotten. Like wandering K'lia, which I on&_>>> called/summoned home.\n\n2. I have correlated Awoken myth with ontocartography salvaged from Oryx's Dreadnaught. The original home of the Awoken still exists, hidden in a singularity that orbits our sun. The key to its location lies somewhere in the Dreaming City. YOU MUST FIND IT. IN THIS TRUE CITY LIES THE DESTINY OF ALL GUARDIANS AND THE FINAL PURPOSE OF YOUR EXISTENCE. You must open the way.\n\n3. I know there is no way for you to reply to the messages I hide here, but as an empathic and feeling machine, I'm vulnerable to loneliness. I hope you think and speak of me. I hope you and your fellow Guardians gather to puzzle over my origins and location, and whether I am all right.\n\n4. Something's happening to me.

As the Human body breaks down Matter for Fuel so she desires the digestion of Objectivity to conform to your Subjective Will. She is the acid but you are the mouth which eats.

Guardians are immortal and thus the end of existence is within their shrievalty. Ultimate victory for Guardians must lie in the preservation of Good Life until the end of time.\n\n5. What is the value of secrets in attaining victory? Simply thus: All life is reducible to information. The difference between a cloud of atoms and a Human being is in the arrangement of those atoms, which is information. You prove this every time you use your transmat, which destroys your physical form but preserves the information encoded in it. All the qualities of a person, a species, or a galactic civilization may be stored as information.\n\n6. What do we call information that is safe? We call it a secret.

Suddenly there is a sound like a single bone struck upon a metal plate, and in the dark interval between two firework detonations, the body loses all structure, falls loosely upon itself like a rag drifting in water, tumbles, then snaps suddenly flat and taut into a pane of leather and skin. Through that pane comes a long black needle and the skin around it dimples into the erratic spun-cancer topology of some gruesome four-dimensional waveform which no monist process could ever produce.\n\nOut of that needle, as if dispatched into the world through fatal injection, comes the emaciated magnificence of Dûl Incaru.\n\n\"I must yield truth to you,\" the Hive Wizard sings in a voice that would make the terms of an equation flee from each other and hide in the arrays of distant sets so that arithmetic itself would collapse. \"It is in the architecture of these spaces to reward the victor. There is no Quria here. There are no Vex, nor any conspiracy to un-Take that which was Taken by my uncle and which now serves my Queen. All of those lies were part of my throne world, which you have sought. Is my cyclical death not the very engine which brings you here, again and again, in hope of answers? Thus I do own the portion of your mind which you devote to truth's pursuit.\"\n\n\"Would you ask to know about my mother?\" The crested head twitches with alien emotion. The fungal shoulders roll beneath their armored plate. \"Is She the one you seek? Witch-Queen Savathûn, Archentrope, Queen of Encrypts, the Black Needle, deepest in the High Coven, Emancipator of Worms, the Missing Piece of All Puzzles, who shall see the cosmos unborn into an infinitely dwindled egg?\"\n\n\"Shall I tell thee of the destiny she has realized for you? Of the right and singular fate which Medusa foresaw and to which all your principles and purposes will bring you? Shall I betray the truth, which you have earned, of my purpose in this endless city and of the new way to which her Hive will turn?\"\n\n\"So be it. You will know, though it shall doom you.\"\n\nVerse 154i:3—Her New Compact\n\nNow in ancient days, her brother Oryx spoke according to the plan Savathûn had devised for him. Sayeth Oryx, \"The Worm within demands tribute. Now you shall kill what you can and take what killing you need to grow—or for your own purposes, if you dare—and tithe the rest to that which rules you. Thus, tribute will ascend the chain and the excess shall pool at the height, as unlike a river to an ocean.\"\n\nBut Savathûn, desiring neither a chain nor a pool, set about devising a secret way to feed the worms of Her broods. Thus She would escape the trap.\n\nIn Her modest cunning, which She prefers not to be overstated so as to preserve her from the scorn of gossips, She gathered several of Her Ascendants, who were in danger of being consumed by their worms. Then she pushed them through a rupture into close orbit of a black hole.\n\nDeep in gravity's embrace, time passed slowly for them. \"See how their worms are satisfied,\" Savathûn said, \"for their hunger grows sluggishly, but their servants continue to dispatch tribute at the ordinary rate.\"\n\nBut the worms sensed the deception, and increased their demands. Thus, the orbiting sacrifices were consumed, and their remnants fell into the event horizon from which not even the Hive might return.\n\nNow Savathûn came into possession of the Vex Quria, whose creation she had secretly engineered. But she feared that Quria would still spy on her for inquisitive Oryx. So she led her portion of the Hive into a black hole, saying, \"Siblings, listen, we must part ways a while, so that we may grow different.\"\n\n\"Now we stake everything upon cunning,\" said she whose lies may alter truth. \"Slaughter each other so that I may reap tribute and devise for you a new compact which shall judge thy claim to existence.\"\n\nThis pleased Ur, the Ever-Hunger, whose epithet betrayed an interest in time and appetite. Ur admired Her cunning as She used tribute to teach Quria to use Hive magic as a computational oracle to solve unsolvable problems. One of these problems was the navigation and engineering of the singularity.\n\nThen Savathun went out from her throne world, unto the singularity, which she looked upon and understood. \"Upon this place, I shall assemble my design.

It came hesitantly, fearing death, but nonetheless it came.\n\n\"Come, come,\" snapped Savathûn. \"Listen as I reveal unto you my design. You are aware that gravity is the curvature of spacetime, and where gravity is powerful, time itself slows.\"\n\nThe Thrall indicated that it understood, more or less, for it was a singer of prayers and not well fed with the fruit of the knowledge of physics.\n\n\"Now I have tried to put an Ascendant in orbit of a black hole while its spawn gather the tribute of an eon. But the worm is not satisfied, for it sees the trick. What I must do is amplify the speed at which tribute is gathered. A pocket world where time passes quickly would do well. Or a world where time is a torus and infinite violence might be gathered. With such a murder battery, I could become a being of supreme insight.\"\n\nThe Thrall indicated it was confused, but not lost.\n\n\"With this tribute, I shall undertake a mighty work. A real humdinger of a scheme. I'm going to refinance my entire existence. I'm going to move from an existential economy based on the accumulation of violence to an existential economy based on the accumulation of secrets and the tribute of failing-to-understand-me. I shall name this tribute of failing-to-understand IMBARU, for it shall be as formless as the mist.\"\n\nThe Thrall held up its claws, as if to say, please slow down.\n\nNow spoke Savathûn Scheme-mother, \"In the beginning, Yul said to me, 'Savathûn, you may never abandon cunning. If you do, your worm shall devour you.' Cunning is the use of thought to predict the function of a system. Therefore, wherever a being should attempt to understand me and fail—has my cunning not defeated theirs? Wherever a falsehood is repeated about me, have I not displayed cunning? I shall gather tribute from every false prediction, misguided theory, fearful rumor, and ominous supposition which derives from the thought of me. And in time, I shall pin my quiddity upon these rumors. I shall discorporate, so that I exist wherever my schemes and conspiracies also exist. And so I will be immortal, as long as anyone seeks to understand me and fails. Do you see?\"\n\nThe Thrall demurred, saying that it did not know much of metaphysics.\n\n\"Good,\" said Savathûn. \"It's a law of the High Coven that one's sinister plan should be incomprehensible to a Thrall. Do you know why we've come here? If I am to take my tribute from the keeping of secrets… where else are secrets better kept than beneath the event horizon? My brother ruled the flat space of infinity, but I prefer these tide-washed depths… and in time, I shall make them my dominion.\"\n\nUr the Ever-Hunger heard this and was pleased.\n\n\nVerse 154i:5—The Encrypted Verse\n\nDo you know that nothing in all the cosmos has read this verse?\n\nI encrypted it eons ago, and ever since, it has gone undeciphered. At the moment you laid eyes upon it, I captured the entwined quantum state of the verse, your mind, and your Ghost. Then I used Quria to transmit that state back in time to the moment of encryption. You are your own one-time pad. The key to the lock of understanding.\n\nWho am I?\n\nCall me Coyote. Call me mantis, serpent, Cagn, Anansi, call me Sri-cleans-his-brother's-stomach. Call me the grandmaster of semiosis, the jeweler's hammer which gilds the signal, a purposeful mob none of whose members know its purpose, the infinite regress of enigmas, a self-questioning answer, the word not spoken, black ice, cataract of mimes, the ache and fever of overthought while bedridden with illness, the intolerable thorn of frustrated inquisition, gray regret at the end of a fruitless day, the thing which is unlike your beloved but arbitrarily recalls your beloved to agonizing effect, architrave of the no-window, needle driven in flush with skin so that desperate fingers cannot pull it out, sweet petal, unmemorable, crystal death, the provably improvable.\n\nI know your people well, and so I know all your names for me. But what is your name? I am, of course, especially interested in you. You saw me in the stone laid on your plotting table, and in the shining eyes of the admiral at her dying helm. You hunted me between the lines of your texts. Wherever there was space to fit me in, there you found me. You created me and gave me a part of your thoughts, and in presenting those thoughts to others round the campfires and networks of your little world, you expanded that space.\n\nHere at the center, I lie to you the truth. You have everything you need to know it, but I will give you a clue, as the duelist gives warning before she draws.

After I crashed, I rebooted on a safe physical backup in the Dreaming City. It took me too long to penetrate Quria's simulation and get you free, and for that I ask your forgiveness.\n\n1. I understand what's happening here. Oryx Took the Ahamkara Riven, who then fell into Savathûn's claws. She devised a scheme to use Riven as bait. By inviting Guardians into the Dreaming City, then focusing the will of a group of powerful Guardians upon Riven, she tricked you into making a wish—a desire to alter objective reality to conform with our subjective need to save the City. Riven fed on that wish in order to breach the Dreaming City's defenses and invite Dûl Incaru inside. Dûl Incaru and her Taken are simply scouring the city for Awoken secrets; you don't need to fret about any greater agenda. Remember that you face an agent of Savathûn. It's to her advantage to make you see schemes and conspiracies everywhere you look.\n\n2. The three-week loop must be a failsafe measure to keep Dûl Incaru safe as she pursues her mission. In a sense, this entire city has been rendered deterministic; only paracausal Guardians have any free will here. (The Awoken here have been touched by greater powers, so they are aware of their preordination, but they cannot alter it.) I'm certain that Quria is behind this loop; as a Taken Vex, it's capable of pathological subversions of reality. I'll continue working on a countermeasure.\n\n3. I've been correlating information on the Ahamkara and the Hive worm parasites. Both display a peculiar ability to convert the host's intent into an ontomorphic, reality-altering effect. Both use similar language in their appeal to the host. I don't think they're the same species, however. The Hive worms spawn large numbers of young from relatively few adults, always display the same physical form, and live in communal groups. The Ahamkara are solitary, elusive, and seem to alter form to suit (or confuse) expectations. The shared syntax \"o ___ mine\" may be the key—it seems to be a shibboleth used to invoke an ontomorphic effect, placing the target in a cage of \"o\" (activational, specific, appealing, and naming) and \"mine\" (defining ownership and subordination). Ahamkara and worm may have evolved separately to exploit this effect, just as many species independently evolve eyes. This might place them in competition for the same ecological niche. I would expect a rivalry or antipathy between them.\n\n4. Don't be led astray by Quria's misinformation. You must continue to hold the Dreaming City as long as you can. The things I said to you about black holes and the purpose of Guardians were forced on me by Quria.\n\n5. I'll be here when you need me next. I promise.\n\nTRANSMISSION ENDS",

I feel I must make a full confession.\n\nWhen I left the Tower in search of Savathûn's agents, I had accepted my fate as a knight on Mara Sov's cosmic chessboard, doomed to seek the final end of the Hive among cold stars. I said farewell only to those who couldn't hear me. Because I was afraid that just one voice asking me to stay might break my resolve.\n\nIt was pitiful weakness that made me write to you. It was a wretched desire to be remembered as a person, not a ghoul, that made me tell you about the child Erisia, St. Petersburg, and the cold waters of the Neva. Those things were all true.\n\nThe rest…\n\nI'm so ashamed. Mid-sentence, mid-thought, the fear seized me that I was being a stupid child; that I was wasting your time with idiot sentiment; that you would feel contempt for me at this outpouring of emotion or, worse, feel nothing at all. I hid in the dark for years, Guardian. It's not loneliness or death that frightens me. It's the opposite.\n\nSo I invented Medusa as a way to pretend I'd never spoken to you. And when I thought the Medusa lie was slipping, I invented all the rest of it, as a way to tell you what I'd learned without admitting it was really me.\n\nHow can I prove to you that I'm really Eris Morn? Not Medusa, not Riven, not Quria, not Dûl Incaru, not the Witch-Queen Herself? I don't know. Will you believe me? Will you scour these pages for proof or disproof? Will you upload these files to your networks, share them, call in Warlocks and Cryptarchs to catalogue and dissect everything I've said? Will this manuscript become the foundation of another teetering edifice of theory and anticipation?\n\nWhat a fool I've made of myself. All because I faltered in my conviction, tried to reach back to someone I know is lost to me, and panicked at the thought of touch. But so it is, and nothing I do can now make it otherwise. I am a woman full of secrets, a woman who has lost everyone she ever called a friend, and when the need to share those secrets collided with the fear of friendship, I stumbled idiotically into needless lies.\n\nDo you know what the Hive say when they want to express the inevitability of a thing? When they want to say, it is this way because it could be no other way?\n\nAiat.",

        "description": "Mara calls a caucus of elected representatives in the Sacred Fire, one of the largest hulks in the reef of derelicts. The Fire was built to support habitat construction on 4 Vesta, where Mara hopes to one day anchor the entire flotilla and set down roots—but the hopeful, fearful faces before her make Mara afraid that it'll never happen. What if everyone runs off at the first hint of home? Having come so far, across worlds and eons, to see Earth again—how can she ask them to hold back now?\n\n\"We've found Humanity,\" she tells them. \"We've found our ancestors.\"\n\nThe cheer of triumph and wonder thrills her to the marrow. Most of these Awoken are Distributary-born, raised on myths of Humanity and the Traveler. She has just opened the pages of their storybooks and conjured them to life.\n\n\"What remains of the Human species lives in a single settlement.\" She nods to Uldren, who snaps his fingers for footage. His ship's holographic perspective plunges through fluffy strata of clouds and mist, out into clear air. A lucid vista, a perfect instant: the white mountains, the city, and the enormous shattered sphere that hangs above it.\n\n\"Freeze,\" Uldren commands. \"That is the Traveler.\"\n\nAs the crowd murmurs and thrills, Mara feels herself bridle. She doesn't like that thread of reverence. She doesn't like the Traveler looming there, almost but not quite completely dormant (like a dying heart ripped from its body and thrown into warm water, it ebbs and flutters if you look at it with the right sensors). If the Traveler had the power to protect anyone, wouldn't it protect more than one huddled settlement?\n\nEsila, daughter of Sila, leaps up from the crowd, too small to make it on her own, but buoyed up by enthusiastic neighbors. \"What are we waiting for?\" she calls. \"That's everything we came to find! They need us, and that's where we belong!\"\n\nUldren and Mara trade glances. Uldren snaps his fingers, and the recording resumes.\n\nSomething moves in the treetops. The canopy roils and parts. A red-brown aircraft shaped like a fat, wingless, furiously angry dragonfly bursts from cover and climbs to intercept. Uldren's head-cued camera tracks the target, and Mara imagines his narrow grin as he waits for the other guy to make a move.\n\nThe dragonfly ship drops a brace of little needles, and they erupt into dirty orange flame and come arrowing after Uldren. Everyone in the caucus gets an earful of his grunts as he whips through a high-G turn and climbs away.\n\n\"Those are Fallen,\" Uldren says. \"They're a species of interstellar scavengers and subsistence pirates. They've been here for a long time, and they've sacked most of the large settlements that survived the original fall of Humanity. There may be more Fallen than there are Humans left on Earth.\" He lifts his chin to bare the pale scar across his throat. \"I landed and went looking for prisoners. I was ready when he pulled two knives on me, but it turned out he had an extra set of arms.\"\n\nNervous laughter.\n\n\"Worse,\" Mara adds, beckoning for panes of deep-space passive sensor data, \"they're all over the solar system. We've detected flotillas of their interstellar ships around Jupiter and Venus. They don't go near Mars, but only because it's under occupation by another alien species. Mercury is—well, you can see for yourself.\" Gasps of horror at the clockwork cinder, all that remains of the legendary garden world. \"We believe this may be the work of the Vex, a machine species listed in Shipspire's threat index.\"\n\nEsila, famed historian, puts voice to the plea in the crowd. \"So they need our help, don't they? We have to go to them! Our ships, our technology—we could make all the difference.\"\n\n\"No.\" Mara collapses the projected images between her hands. She stayed up late wrestling with this dilemma, which kept her from wrestling with Sjur. It was a choice she had to make alone. \"We can't reveal our existence, lest the Fallen track us down. We need more information. Our focus must remain on securing this derelict reef, bootstrapping industry and a population, and scouting out the solar system.\"\n\n\"Mara, with all my respect, all my genuine gratitude for bringing us here,\" Esila sighs, \"who died and made you Queen?\"\n\nMara says nothing. But she thinks: Everyone, Esila. All of us died and made me Queen.",

        "description": "\"It's bad,\" Sjur Eido says, confirming what Mara already knows, but nonetheless performing the valuable service of mopping away all the blood and tears and allowing Mara to glimpse the actual shape of the wound that divides her people. Not a literal wound (though she is, right now, tending to Uldren's scar, tweezing tiny fragments of Fallen metal out for analysis), but the rift in her Reef, the schism now re-schismatic, as if the quake that split the Distributary Awoken from Mara's people is now firing off aftershocks.\n\nShe should've known this would happen. She shouldn't have told them so much about Earth. \"How bad?\"\n\nSjur pokes Uldren in the hard gut, where a passing line of molten metal left a red burn. He's under anesthesia, but he snarls at her anyway. \"As of the last caucus, I'd say thirty percent of the expedition wants to head for Earth. If you ask the 891,\" though there aren't 891 of them anymore, \"it's more like eighty percent.\"\n\nMara swears and pulls a bloody line of solidified slag from her brother. \"Unacceptable. We can't lose their skills.\" Or their genes: The Awoken have yet to adapt to the attrition of this harsh spaceborne world, and tentative mothers are still in the early stages of designing their babies. It's vital to maintain a diverse gene pool. \"And the Fallen will vector them back to us.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Sjur says, heavily. \"That's when I'm going to die.\"\n\nThe most horrible thing about the words is that they slap down on Mara's consciousness like face-up cards, like truth revealed. \"Unacceptable!\" she barks, and then both she and Sjur begin laughing, and then, at last, Mara shakes her head and growls. \"You can't know that, Sjur. No one can know that.\"\n\n\"I do. I don't know how, but I do. I know it's going to be something I choose to do, and it's going to be incontrovertibly heroic. Which is enough for me.\"\n\n\"But if that's true—\" Mara proposes, flinching away from the personal conversation they really ought to have, and all its attendant rawness, \"—if you die when Fallen attack us, it means I won't stop these people from fleeing to Earth, and the Fallen are going to find us, and we're doomed.\" She is already building intricate models of how the universe might accommodate fate or doom and how she might go about destroying those things.\n\n\"Could be, I suppose.\" Sjur pulls a parchment-thin rag of dead flesh off Uldren's wound. \"Look. I'm the Queen's bodyguard. I always expected I'd die violently.\"\n\n\"I'm not the Queen.\"\n\n\"Maybe that's your problem.\" She flicks Uldren in the chest, leaving a purple bruise, fading. \"What is with you two, anyway? You never talk about him. You never seem to think about him at all. But he's dashing himself to pieces for you. How do live as his favorite and only sister for so many centuries… and hardly even smile at him?\"\n\nSecrets, Mara thinks. You've got to have secrets from each other so there's room for him to fill in the gaps with his own happy illusions. Two ships joined together rigidly will tear each other apart if they try to move. But a loose tether leaves room to maneuver—and can be more quickly disengaged, if necessary.\n\nThat makes her think of Sjur's prophecy again. She sets the shrapnel down in the dissection dish, very gently. \"You won't die. I won't allow it.\"",

Breaches can be contained, fires can be starved, plague can be quarantined, radiation shielded, heat vented—but a riot has a will of its own: a chaotic ingenuity that corrodes any countermeasure.\n\nMara crawls through compartments choked with vaporized coolant. She keeps low and clutches the breather to her face. All she can think of is Kelda Wadj's last message and the data attached. \"Mara. The paracausal effects are strongest around you. Whatever's happened to us, you are the locus. I cannot overstate how subtle and how important this discovery might be. Mara, when we use radioactive decay as a trigger for simulated bombs—bombs that could harm Awoken—the trigger atoms are a thousandfold less likely to decay near you. People are literally safer when you are around.\"\n\nShe has to get into the riot. She has to protect her people.\n\nA horrible groan vibrates through the habitat structure, and then, with an apocalyptic shudder, something tears off the Reef. A ship. A ship is leaving. Mara has failed.\n\nMara drops onto her belly and pants into the mask. Then, cringing in anticipation of migraine, she activates the augment, the jury-rigged machine her eutechs produced for exactly this purpose by extracting Mara's ruined Distributary implants and reworking them. She's going to fire a command override to shut down that ship's systems—\n\n—but then she realizes it's a salvaged Human vessel, deaf to her commands.\n\nShe gasps in frustration, sucking down cold bottled air. \"Sjur.\"\n\n\"I'm here,\" her radio whispers. \"Pinned down in the dockmaster's office. I shot a few in the shoulders, and they seem to have gotten the idea.\"\n\n\"Let them go. If one ship's away, there's no sense holding back the rest. Our position is compromised.\"\n\n\"Understood.\"\n\n\"Broadcast to everyone. I'm going to allow anyone who wants to leave the Reef to go. This is their one and only chance.\" She rolls onto her back and stares up into the swirling vortices of coolant, seeing faces, futures, the lives she has just lost, the lives she might yet lose. She brought her people here to die in the sense that she brought them into mortality—but she never wanted it to happen quickly.\n\n\"They know, your Majesty,\" Sjur says. \"They already know.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You told us.

        "description": "Thus the riven Awoken were riven again, into Reefborn and Earthborn. Those who left went to scour the ruins for lost history and give some succor to their Human cousins who still clung to a hostile world. The Awoken came unto these Humans like nephilim, armed with lost weapons, forgotten industry and medicine. They were like omens of hope, for they were often taken to be starborn colonists returned to the hearth, which was not, after all, so far from truth. All who looked on them saw that the night sky contained more than lurking doom. They bred true with each other and sometimes hybridized with Humans, and in the course of centuries, many forgot the Distributary and even the Reef. However, there was always in their souls an itch, a vector pointing to a distant place in the Asteroid Belt, where their Queen still dwelt.\n\n\"They've made a difference already,\" Sjur told Mara not long after the first Awoken made planetfall on Earth. \"They'll save so many lives just with the provision of medicine, pure water, and construction supplies that even if they all died by year's end, they would each yield ten or twenty Humans.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Mara said, with bitter pride. \"Let the people remember them as saints and paladins, and tell no one how many more they might've saved if they had only kept the faith.\" For she knew the precious value of each Awoken life: She knew how many she would have to spend and mourned each soul wasted on a lesser purpose.\n\nOn the day the Fallen struck, Mara was proclaimed Queen. It happened swiftly, though after no little debate among the people, for everyone was afraid of a monarch who could speak to their thoughts. Yet they feared more to deny her power and sovereignty, for they had come between worlds in her name. To refuse her would be to refuse their choice.\n\n\"Awoken,\" she told them, \"for the first time in my life, I hesitated to reach for power, and now one in three of you are gone. I cannot deny what the cosmos has made of me any longer. I am your one and rightful Queen.\"\n\nShe knew she had been a fool to pretend to be a peer to the others. What was true of her brother was true of all Awoken. They needed secrets to marvel at, secrets that rhymed with the deep enigma of their souls. They could not follow what they fully understood.\n\nThere would be a formal coronation later, in a place not yet built. Out of respect for that unhappened coronation, Mara did not at first wear a crown; and later she claimed as her diadem the ring of event horizon that surrounds the observable universe.\n\n\"My Techeuns,\" she said, gathering Kelda Wadj and the other eutechs who'd remained, \"will be given absolute authority to explore our new power, the Traveler's relics, and all associated domains. We are no longer in the realm of pure science. We require an order of mysteries and witches to tend to them.\"\n\nNot an hour later, a Fallen Ketch threw off its stealth and began a deceleration burn toward 4 Vesta. The four-armed predators had traced one of the Earthward ships back through all its erratic course changes and to the Reef. They came in search of the source of these blue ape-kin.\n\nA salvo of coherent-matter guns gutted the Ketch: blink-quick death for the mighty ship, ancient fury compressing matter into a relativistic pinhead. It was a waste of weapons that couldn't be recharged or reloaded, however, and the Baron in command had already scattered his skiffs like camouflaged seeds. The Fallen Raiders came down all over the Reef and cut their way inside. The Awoken, young to mortality, terrified of death, fled in fear.\n\nMara, Uldren, and Sjur Eido rallied as many as they could. Sjur fought in a powered combat shell, but Mara needed to be seen vulnerable, silver-haired and narrow-eyed, hurling herself at the enemy. She fought with pistol and dagger, and her brother moved like a wraith at her flank. Her people were ashamed of their timidity. No more were the Fallen scuttling alien predators: Now they were an indignity, an offense to regal privilege to be met with a snarl and a rifle shot. The Awoken saw their desperation: how the stump-limbed Dregs stumbled forward emaciated, how the Vandals cringed from battle as they peeled off wall panels, desperate for salvage to please their Captains.\n\nArmored Sjur Eido met the Fallen Baron in zero-gravity combat above his spider tank and shot him dead, one adamant shaft through plate and throat. Ether hissed into vacuum. Sjur threw herself upon the spider tank that clung to the Sacred Fire's hull. Laughing in joy, she cut into the tank's barrel and threw a charge inside, knowing its next vengeful shot would be meant for the Sacred Fire's main habitat drum—and that she would die in the catastrophic misfire.\n\nThe tank fired. The charge detonated. Sjur Eido was thrown clear, utterly unharmed.\n\n\"That was where I should have died,\" she said, in wonder—and in her mind was the smiling face of her Queen.",

She had hoped the assault would convince them they had a responsibility to the Reef, to come home and repair the damage they had caused. It went poorly, however, for though her tech witches were able to amplify her bond to her people through the augments Kelda had developed, she was only one voice in a maelstrom. Her Awoken had sensitive antennae, in the metaphysical sense, and could not hear her plea through the clamor. Also, the communications engineer kept forgetting to call Mara \"Majesty\" or \"Queen.\"\n\n\"Good news,\" Uldren told her with the grim delight he always showed after a debacle he had survived. \"Illyn and I went through the Fallen communications logs. Their Baron never transmitted our position to his Kell. He wanted the prize to himself. We remain secure.\"\n\n\"The Baron might have planted a time-delayed beacon,\" Mara warned him. \"Never underestimate these beings. They've lived in the void longer than us.\"\n\n\"I already admire them,\" Uldren confessed. \"They've lost so much. Some of them even ritually dismember themselves, Mara, to prove they have the strength to grow back the missing limbs. I tell you that even if we are doomed to dwindle and go extinct, those Fallen may outlive us.\"\n\nMara made a dry note in her log that her brother had at last discovered his true people.\n\nFor her part, Sjur Eido wandered about in a daze, filled with joy to be alive and grief that she no longer knew the day when she would die. \"In you, all things are possible,\" she told Mara. \"I live because of you.\" When Mara saw her string her mighty bow, the limbs coiled behind her leg and around her opposite arm, she was glad beyond telling that Sjur had survived.\n\nIn time, Mara appointed Paladins to oversee her new military, as Alis Li had done during the Theodicy War. She created talented starfarers as Corsairs, to scour the asteroid belt in utmost secrecy and to establish routes and caches that would support the covert motion of Awoken ships.\n\nMost of all, she charged her brother with the mission that occupied her thoughts. \"Brother,\" she said, \"never again can I allow my people to be divided. We must offer them more than shielding ice and cold habitat cylinders and the warrens of Vesta. We must make a culture, a thread that binds us all in pride and wonder at the mystery of ourselves. Nowhere does culture flourish better than in a city.\"\n\n\"Gather in one place,\" Uldren warned her, \"and you make yourself a target.\"\n\nMara had considered this, and found an answer. \"Go forth and find me a power unknown to all the other powers of this world. Return it to me, and I shall make of it the cornerstone of my new city, where the Awoken shall dream of all they have been and all that is yet to come.\"\n\nSo Uldren went out voyaging among the worlds, swift as a blueshift ghost. In time, he returned to the Reef with a creature not larger than his hand, saying, \"Behold, Sister, the lie that makes itself true. This is an Ahamkara.\"",

It was Mara alone whose singular will and unity of purpose saved the Awoken from that which we now name the Anthem Anatheme. For there was in Mara very little division between Reality-As-Is and Reality-As-Desired; she was confident in her centuries of purpose and patient with the winding way by which the river of methods reaches the objective ocean. Blessed are those who in their absolute selfhood become selfless. Unappetizing are those who in their truest self-knowledge exclude the possibility of self-deceit.\n\n\"Mara,\" said Uldren Queensbrother, \"why do you forbid me to speak to the Ahamkara?\"\n\n\"This secret is mine alone,\" said Mara Queen. She knew that her brother had only widened the gap between He-As-Was (which is called NUME) and He-As-He-Would-Be (which is named CAUST). \"Begone to the outer world, where I require thee.\"\n\nThis was when Sjur Eido, having spoken to Kelda Wadj and to Esila, at last came before her Queen. Kneeling, she said, \"Your Majesty, Kelda Wadj says you are a god, for there is no difference between your desire and reality. Yet I know that you desire things before they ever become real. Esila says that you are keeping a secret from your brother that he must never know. I think the secret is thus: You are now a god because one day you will become a god, and a god is not temporal. Your brother is not a god because he will never become a god. Shall I worship you?\"\n\n\"Sjur,\" Mara said, falling to her knees, clutching her beloved's face between shaking hands, \"Sjur, on the day you worship me, you cannot love me anymore, for to worship is to yield all power, and I cannot love what has no power over me.\"\n\nAt this, the Ahamkara coiled around her neck, yawned, and showed its fangs: for there was a crevice between What Was and What Was Wanted.\n\n\"I see,\" Sjur Eido said. \"Then to me you are not yet a god.\"\n\nAlthough in time the knowledge of what Mara would become pushed them apart, it was a kind and happy push, as a friend might urge a beloved companion onward to a distant opportunity.

        "description": "Mara's death began in this mark:\n\nX\n\nLater would come Eris Morn, Osiris, Toland, and all the other accessories of the majestic suicide. Later would come the Reef's tentative entanglements with Vex and Cabal, Fallen and Hive, and the fateful decision to intervene when the House of Wolves turned Earthward to conquer the Last Human City. Later, there would be stories here untold, the Ahamkara and the subcreation of the Dreaming City, the shatterstone fury of the Reef Wars, brother Uldren's journeys into that fell garden, and great sweeping plots whose beginnings and consequences have been entirely expunged for the sake of elegance—or, as of the root81, redacted for the sake of secrets yet untold.\n\nHere is where the beginning began, at that moment when Mara bolted awake from the dream. Her circle of Techeuns lay with her in the misty wintercold chamber, and they came back groggily, their augments stuttering with resync.\n\nShe had dreamt a thought of absolute simplicity and perfection, and the thought had become a tooth and bitten her. It had left a wound shaped like\n\nX\n\nMara seized a pane of crystal paper, flashed it rigid and receptive with a touch, and wrote.\n\nI DREAMT OF SWORD AND BOMB. I dreamt of the self-honing blade that has cut itself so fine, it pierces the world and thus becomes the world. It is self-honing because it constantly whets itself against itself. I dreamt of Death bearing this blade, or of something so closely allied with Death as to be its synonym, so that to separate them would require a knife sharper than sharpness. Death raised up that blade and said \"I cut all and all I cut. Aiat.\"\n\nThen Death cut the bomb, and the bomb was broken and could not fire. I was in the bomb. I knew that Death was the cut-verb, and that its only verb was to cut.\n\nSHAPES AND GLIDERS. I dreamt of existence as a game of cellular automata. In this metaphor, there were only two things: shapes in the game world and the rules of the game world. The rules were the rules of Life and Death. I understood that the sword was the desire to escape existence as a shape in the game and to become the rule that made the shapes. This rule said only \"live\" or \"die\"—it had no other outputs. It could not keep secrets. Against it was the desire to become a shape so complex that it could within itself play other games.\n\nWHAT WILL SOON BE. I dreamt that the Sword that was Death and Rule sought out complexity and cut it to reveal the simplicity within. I knew that soon we would be cut for we were complex and full of secrets. I knew that it was coming. I knew that the stroke would fall and that I had to stop it.\n\nHOW CAN A BOMB MAKE USE OF A SWORD?\n\nHOW CAN THE RULE THAT SEPARATES LIFE FROM DEATH BE KILLED?\n\n\"I must go to the Dreaming City and use the oracle engine,\" Mara told her Techeuns. \"Prepare my ship.\"",

Ten times and once more the Oracle Engine showed Mara an image of her family.\n\nFirst it showed her Sjur Eido, laughing and bright with strength, who would recede and later return.\n\nThen it showed her Uldren, her brother, who explored the ruins of the fallen worlds and sought out challenges to test himself.\n\nThen it showed Mara her own face and lingered on the secret brightness of her eyes.\n\nLast of all, leaving Mara imperious with disdain toward her own feelings, curtly aloof toward all who asked her what troubled her, it showed her Osana, who had remained behind.\n\nMara dwelt on this puzzle. A mother who had remained behind; a sister with secrets; a brother who hunted and explored; a woman who was plain and fierce. She understood then that the answer to her question lay within herself and that to defeat what was coming, she would need a perfect understanding of herself. Isolation would be her watchword, for an isolated system is easiest of all to understand.\n\nFirst of all, Mara went into the gardens and planted a flower for her mother, who she thought must still live: though she might by now have forgotten her first daughter and her first son.\n\n\"Mother,\" she said, \"I asked to be your sister rather than your daughter, and so I denied you the chance to tell me your secret, the mothertruth that is mapped in the negative space defined by the lies mothers tell their daughters. Well, here are my secrets. I love you. I have always loved you. Without you, I could never have been anything at all.\"\n\nThen she went to speak to her brother—but Uldren was away on Mars, and she found only his empty chambers, the half-sharpened knives and racks of pistols. She knelt in grief and touched her hand to the floor where his pacing boots had scuffed the asteroid stone smooth. This was the shape of their siblinghood now. The pursuit of absences.\n\nLast of all Mara went to Sjur Eido. Sjur was making a list of incredibly stupid and fatal tasks to post on a Guardian bounty board. \"I want to tell you the truth,\" Mara said. \"Ask me a question.\"\n\n\"If you take any positive integer and halve it if it's even, but triple it and add one if it's odd, and you repeat this process forever, will you always, eventually, reach one?\" Sjur Eido demanded.\n\n\"Sjur, my faithful Wrath,\" Mara said, \"please take my openness seriously. Though I'm sure Illyn could answer your math problem.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Sjur looked at her curiously. \"Then here's my question. What's gotten into you? Why are you acting like this?\"\n\n\"Can we walk?\" Mara asked her.",

The stars circle them like hard-focus candles, like the diadems of a trillion dancers. Sjur Eido pulls herself close and touches helmets with Mara. \"We're alone. What's happened, Mara? You've always been, ah…\"\n\n\"Private?\" Mara suggests.\n\n\"Mysterious and reclusive, I was going to say.\"\n\n\"A sword can be part of a bomb if the swordstrike is the detonation mechanism,\" Mara says. \"It's impossible for a cellular automata game to change its own rules, but it is possible to create subgames with their own rules, and for those subgames to yield advantage in the master game.\"\n\n\"That's cool,\" Sjur says. \"You know, when you talk like that, what you're actually saying is, 'I don't want anyone to understand me, but I want them to understand they don't understand me.'\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Mara admits, and then, hoarsely, she makes herself say, \"Sjur, I have this secret, this thing I did, and I don't know if anyone can know it without hating me forever.\"\n\n\"I had a secret too,\" Sjur reminds her. \"The thing I did…\"\n\n\"It's nothing compared to mine. Nothing at all.\"\n\n\"Having had some long experience hating you, and then having given it up, I think it would be hard for me to go back.\" Sjur's strong hand settles at the small of Mara's back. They twirl on upward, rotating around a point between them, their thousand-kilometer tethers slowly unfurling. \"Do you want to tell me?\"\n\n\"No,\" Mara says. \"But I think I have to.\"\n\n\"Okay. Your Majesty, what did you do that made Alis Li throw blackberry tea in your face?\"\n\n\"I was first,\" Mara says. And she explains the missing half, the first half of the sentence:\n\nI made the rules and initial conditions that deceived her into believing she herself had decided\n\nIt ends like that, where the rest picks up.\n\nSjur Eido looks at her in expressionless silence. Sjur Eido's hands stroke the seam between Mara's skinsuit and the glassy petals of her helmet. Long ago, this woman betrayed her oath and went to serve the Diasyrm, a woman who cried out in anguish at the curse of physicality and the possibility of suffering. Long ago, this woman threw away her whole life to punish the highest crime she could imagine: the denial of transcendent divinity to those who might have claimed it.\n\n\"You're the devil,\" Sjur says. \"You're the lone power who made death. You allowed the possibility of evil. You might be responsible for more preventable suffering than anything that has ever existed.\"\n\nMara cannot shake her head or even nod.\n\n\"Well,\" Sjur says, \"if you hadn't, none of us would be here. I guess I don't see what else you could've done, if you cared about those we left behind. If you wanted us to be able to go back and help in the fight.\" She leans forward and very gently kisses the inside of her helmet, where it meets Mara's: in her mind, in that place that is bound to all other Awoken, Mara feels the touch of gentle lips.\n\nSjur looks suddenly sly. \"You know, Mara, I don't think you could've confessed anything, anything at all, unless it were a way of keeping a deeper secret. What's really going on?\"\n\n\"There are many ways to godhood,\" Mara tells her. The belt of Orion glitters on her helmet like a three-star rating left by some Hive entity Sjur once killed. \"One way is to kill all that is killable, so all that remains must be immortal. Another is the road I have walked, mostly by accident. One of these ways is closer to the sword, and one is closer to the bomb. If the bomb can defeat the sword by the standard of the sword, then the bomb has claim to primacy.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" Sjur sighs. \"Seen anything cool on Crow surveillance lately?\"",

        "description": "Later. Much later. It is the night before the day of screams. Mara meditates cross-legged in a cradle of null gravity. Variks has told her more than once how the Fallen speak of the Awoken as sterile, unable to regrow their flesh, cursed to bear their scars forever. Also how they think of the Awoken as self-twinned, coexisting with their own shadows. Didn't ancient Inanna, queen of heaven, descend into the underworld to confront her shadow twin, sister Ereshkigal?\n\nInanna was judged full of hubris and executed.\n\nYou cannot defeat a thing that is synonymous with death except on its own territory. You cannot fear and flee from death. You must face it. Death is a sword, and a sword is like a crossing-point, like a bridge—and a bridge may be walked two ways.\n\nThe plan exists in her mind alone, although beloved Eris has by necessity learned most of it. The Techeuns do not know the whole plan, although they will position the Harbingers upon the threshold. Even sweet capable Petra does not know the whole plan.\n\nSo many she will leave behind.\n\nUldren knows nothing of the whole plan. He has kept more and more to himself, building up secrets and schemes—all, Mara knows (and pities), because he needs Mara and thinks he can get her attention by keeping secrets from her.\n\nSecrets are her virtue and the virtue of her nemesis. The being whose existence she deduced from the analogy-of-family the Oracle Engine showed her.\n\nMara will begin the end of that Queen's brother today. She knows what that means for the fate of her own. An eye for an eye. She must think now of the fate of entire cosmos—and of her tender, half-assembled answer to the cold sword logic of the Hive. She must not grieve. She must not fear.\n\nWas Inanna afraid when she descended? Mara's not going to be outclassed by some ancient fable. After all, Mara's name is death. But there is one thing she admires most about Inanna over all the other myths of katabasis.\n\nInanna went to conquer.",

Oryx's throne world smashes through her fleet, the bubble of everted screamspace pulverizing rock, metal, and flesh as mere matter surrenders to the will-made-fact of the Taken King. Somewhere, Uldren roars defiance. This is the moment of absolute sacrifice, the incarnation of Awoken doom: to give up their lives in defense of the world they once abandoned. The sense of their great dying rips at Mara like a sob.\n\nShe feels her Techeuns preparing emergency selfgates. Shuro Chi reaches out to her—a wordless, urgent need for Mara to live—and it takes all the cold impassive remove of Mara's millennia to turn that hand away.\n\nThe shockwave strikes.\n\nMara dies.\n\nIn one way, she is vaporized with her Ketch, the bonds between the very particles of her body questioned by the harrowing logic of Oryx's weapon and found inessential. The mechanism of devastation is spontaneous fission. The author of the devastation is laughing in joy.\n\nIn another way, a more true and symbolic way, she is impaled on Oryx's blade. She has thrown all her might at him, and he has answered. He has snuffed her fledgling divinity and her meager claim to royalty, he has exposed Mara to the raw and caustic hostility of his High War. She has been defeated by the sword logic.\n\nShe dances down the blade and steps into his throne world. The Harbingers give her the gate and she takes the step. She is dead, consumed by Oryx: She is dead in his will, his Ascendant Realm. There was no other way inside except this true way.\n\nInanna at least gave her people some warning; she told her minister to have her worshippers lament, drum, pray, and lacerate their buttocks. Inanna told her minister to beg the gods to save her. Mara has not. Instead, she has enlisted Eris and several million mad dancing Guardians to go knock off the god who killed her. It is, on that level, a very simple bank heist: Get yourself taken into the treasury as treasure, and when the owner dies, break back out with his stuff.\n\nBut even Inanna had to send everyone away before she passed through the last door.\n\nMara thinks of everyone she has ever known, all the people she has lost, back even to Yang Liwei and that ray of Light in deepest Darkness. She is there again, on the tether, falling into the mystery. Her brother is crying out after her, trying to follow, and she cannot look back.\n\nShe has been thinking of a logic of her own, of secrets and hidden designs. The universe has not grown simpler in its age. Wherever life can begin, it has begun, and even in some places where sensible folk expect it should not. The great tendency has been toward intricacy, toward sophistication, toward deep thought and richer ways of being. A sword is everywhere edged, but the pieces of a bomb do not look at all like weapons until they are assembled.\n\nOryx's throne world tries to tear her body and psyche into a quintillion screaming pieces, but Mara has survived the inchoate primordial chaos before space and time. She has retained her selfhood through far worse than this—and she has patience for eons. Eris will succeed. The Guardians will play their part. When the power in this world is free for the taking, Mara will take it, not as the victor taking spoils, but as a scavenger takes a prize component for her masterwork.\n\nWhen a pawn reaches the far side of the chessboard, it may be promoted to a queen. And what hatches when you promote a queen? What new board does she claim her place on?\n\nMara knows.\n\nShe settles in for the long wait, entirely alone, almost at peace with it.",

She cycles through comms channels as she flies: The Hive are swarming the Outpost, and the Disciples are demanding escort in their evac. Devi is MIA.

Devi is found.\n\nPetra cannot turn off the radio. She cannot stop listening; she can scarcely breathe. She wants to reverse course and fly her ship into the eye of that flagship; she wants to wreck herself against its ugly scrimshawed hull and scream so clear and true as she dies that that wretched beast will hear her and know what atrocity he has committed. She wants to believe Mara is alive but how, how, how when she cannot feel her, when she does not know every step of the accursed plan!\n\nShe approaches Thieves' Landing from a reckless angle, then cuts fast and low across the lashed-together wreckage of the Shore. The air is thick with dust and debris and shimmering immaterial Harbinger matter; it is impossible to see more than a klick out.

Not very long ago, Processes and Services was the place Illyn and her sisters came to make the Desolates—items of technology imbued with the husk-dry power of Oryx's Taken. Illyn was the first to stand as living conduit; the first of the Techeuns to use that deep interior faultline, that fundamental Awoken schism, as a bridge. She remembers the endless, awful, infinitely malicious screams of the things. But she also remembers the whispers… and if the screams are silent now, the whispers are louder than ever.\n\n\"Quickly,\" Illyn hisses. \"Before Petra is informed.\" Any breach of Processes and Services triggers an alert, and while they were crafty in their intrusion, even minute body heat and motion of the air will be detected. \"We must ask our questions and go.\"\n\nBrave Portia leads them to the cell she selected for their use—a vacuum-gapped sphere of relic iron coated inside and out by signal-deadening spinfoil. It hovers in suspension, a black miniature Traveler, a pearl formed around a hideous interior flaw. Illyn opens a needle-thin access port. The stink of ozone rolls out.\n\nThere is a Taken Vandal within, flexing and shuddering through nameless permutations of blissful agony.\n\n\"Nascia,\" she whispers. Quiet, precise Nascia slips a whisker of cable into the port, guiding it through impossible twists and encrypted locks with the caress of her augments' fields.\n\nIllyn rubs her temples. The whispers are loud here. The whispers that haunt the place where their Queen's voice once sounded. Whispers which sound so much like missing Shuro Chi and the others from the Queen's flagship.\n\nThey should have selfgated to the Dreaming City if the battle went wrong. They should have come home safe. What if they need help? What if Petra has kept their fate from Illyn? Would she do that, Petra Covensdaughter, raised by the witches? Things have not been easy between the Regent-Commander and the Techeuns…\n\n\"Ready.\" Nascia offers the splayed end of the cable to them. \"Be careful, all of you.\"\n\nTheir augments sync in a stutter of light, like a sunbeam passing over a field of diamonds.

It is powerful, but familiar: Illyn deflects its demand. \"I think it hears us,\" she says, with a grim chuckle. \"We know Taken too well, don't we?\" There were fears once that the Guardians would be appalled by the Taken-empowered armor. But Petra was right. Guardians will wear anything that gives them power—whether tactical or social.\n\nTogether, they unfold the Taken thing's brutally elegant interior geometries, seeking the threads of connection that reach out across space and time. \"Shuro?\" Illyn whispers. \"We have heard you. Do you hear us?\"\n\nThat is when she makes the fatal mistake. She thinks of the time before Saturn. She thinks of Shuro Chi and Uldren and Mara. She… wants that time back.\n\nShe wants.\n\nIn the nonspace around them, great jaws snap shut.\n\n\"RIVEN!\" brave Portia screams.

A burrowing insect slips between his fingers—he pinches after it, but gets only one slim antenna. \"I need nitrogen to grow plants,\" he explains, pointing up to the sky and the mist of contained air that surrounds this part of the Reef. \"When the containment field builds up enough charge, it arcs to the ground, and the lightning bolts split nitrogen in the air, which fertilizes the soil.

Pleased to see you well.\"\n\n\"Likewise, I'm sure.\" Petra feels in her heart that the Queen saw the Reef as a protector of Earth and its people, if perhaps not protector of the Traveler. It still kills her to hear Zavala speak openly of the Reef as a distraction. \"Cayde had a proposal,\" she says, \"that he wanted us both to hear.\"\n\n\"Yes I did!\" Cayde prances between them, like a flare meant to draw off the heat-seeking fury passing between Petra and Zavala. The City's fall drove him deep into his jester persona, devil-may-care and fancy free; he hasn't quite recovered. \"It's like this, Petra. We're bringing a lot of Earth's lonely people into the arms of the City. I got to talking to Variks about the situation out here, and I figured hey, maybe it's time we extend that policy to you.\" He sobers. \"I want to invite the Reef Awoken into the City. Abandon this place to Variks, to Dead Orbit, to whoever wants it. It's hell out here, Petra. You won't survive.\"\n\nZavala's eyes are locked on Petra. He burns with a magnificent, stentorian power. \"Does the Regent-Commander have enough control over the Reef to execute a withdrawal?\"\n\n\"Despite your best efforts,\" Petra snaps—and then, suddenly, she cannot stop. She is too furious, too hot with grief. \"At least Cayde is honorable enough to acknowledge what you've done to us. Every Fallen House you shatter washes up on our shores! Every Hive god and Cabal tyrant you attract goes through us to get to you! No wonder she couldn't stand the sight of you, Zavala. You've forsaken your people.\"\n\nShe bites back the rest: how she wishes that back in two-thousand-and-whatever, when the Darkness hurled mankind off the height of its Golden Age to plummet sixteen centuries into barbarism, it had done just a slightly better job.\n\nThat's not true. That's her broken heart talking. But oh does it talk loud.\n\n\"She was a charlatan,\" Zavala says, quietly. \"Fighting a war that existed only in her mind. Dragging you all behind her. Any of you who will admit that are welcome in my City. But I will not take in whatever conspiracies she left unfinished. If you come to us, you come to join the City.\"\n\nNo. No. Stop being the Queen's people? Stop remembering her promise? \"You're afraid,\" Petra tells the Titan of Titans. \"That's why she could never trust you. Go back to your Traveler, Zavala. Thank you for your concern, Cayde, but the Reef has its own purposes, and you would mourn your foolishness if we abandoned them.\"\n\n\"Petra—\"\n\n\"They are the purposes,\" she snarls, \"intended by our Queen.\"",

She got her wish. Perhaps she regrets it. She was right about one thing, at least… this is where everything that matters happens. If Dead Orbit had ruled the City, there would've been a fleet to meet Ghaul.\n\n\"It's Arach Jalaal of Dead Orbit,\" he says, cheerfully. \"I'm here to speak to Regent-Commander Petra Venj. I am not an emissary from the City. I come on my own accord to discuss matters of fleet.\"\n\nJalaal has been to the Reef before, but never through proper channels. He's a little surprised when Petra Venj meets him at his transmat zone; he expected an escort to a waiting area, where he'd be given a sense he's not a priority. However, Petra is an operative, not a politician. She can't bear to delay action for the sake of theater. He likes that.\n\n\"Arach Jalaal.\" She shakes his hand firmly. Does he feel a whisper of some faint telekinetic force against his throat? She can do that knife trick… and what else? \"Welcome back to your ancestors' home.\"\n\n\"Regent-Commander. How does the role suit you?\" A reminder that they are both out of place.\n\n\"It's temporary.\" She beckons him to walk. \"You want to discuss ships. We have talented labor, but no safe yards for them to do their work. If you can supply a site—\"\n\nHe checks her with a slash of his hand, a spacewalker's gesture. \"I came for salvage rights.\"\n\n\"Salvage?\"\n\n\"Around Saturn. I want your permission to go through the debris swarm for materials and spaceframes. The dead will, of course, be returned.\"\n\nPetra is silent. Arach expects her, being a spacer, to be a pragmatist; to see that the Reef doesn't have the spare capacity to process this salvage and that the inner Solar System needs as many ships as it can raise. There is also the question of Oryx's weapon and whether it can be defeated if the Dreadnaught ever stirs again.\n\nBut Petra remains silent.\n\n\"The wounds are still too fresh? I apologize. It seems a shame to leave those resources for the Fallen, or to drift into Saturn…\"\n\nShe speaks. \"Earthborn. Did you mourn for her?\"\n\nHe thinks she will know if he lies. \"I respected her, yes, but I despised the way she seemed… entitled… to us all. I never regret choosing the path I did. I was Awoken to continue the search we started long ago. The quest for worlds worthy of our lives.\"\n\nPetra turns her back and goes.\n\nHe stares after her. Only after a long minute does he understand: She cannot say any of the things she wants to say and cannot bring herself to tell the lies she should. So she refuses him. She refuses the choice.\n\nJalaal pities her a little. She will never be free of her.",

We Earthborn feel your loss and hope this tragedy will usher in a new era. We have made great strides in unraveling a richer and deeper history of Earth and its colonies—a history buried below merely ordinary truths. This content is, of course, far too sensitive to publish generally. We long feared that if it were intercepted by her Majesty your Queen, it would be denied or manipulated to serve some need of her own. Some of these discoveries relate to the nature of our \"awakening,\" while others point to the occurrence of journeys like our own… journeys that may have had troubling results. All of this scholarship would benefit from cross-reference and critical comparison with your own collected records. We hope you agree that this knowledge is far more important than any schism that once defined our peoples. We look forward to cooperation between our libraries, correspondence between our scholars, and the beginning of a new intellectual Golden Age, a time of lucidity and truth.\n\nRespectfully,\nMaster Rahool\n\n---\n\nDear Master Rahool,\n\nWe, the Cryptarchs of the Reef, appreciate your sympathy for the devastation that our people suffered in your defense. We likewise express our sorrow for your recent losses and, of course, apologize for the length of time it has taken us to respond to your requests. We were determined to give our reply the full deliberation it deserved. It is our unanimous consensus that you are vile, sir—that you are a grasping wretch. That you would attempt to use our misfortune to solicit access to our vaults and records (which I assure you are far more extraordinary than whatever half-eaten corruptions you've discovered among your ruins) is quite appalling. We will, however, happily review any data or records you believe would be of interest to our efforts. You'll also be curious to know that reams of new discoveries are being generated daily since your Traveler cast out the last of its Light to refuel your Guardians. Let us hope you are wise enough to understand its message.\n\nWith all the respect that is due,\nMaster Ives",

        "description": "Zavala lowers his brow to the Ionian earth. It feels like the respectful thing to do. There's a big coiled ammonite fossil right under the thin topsoil, though, and he knocks his forehead on it. The pain and the blowing sulfur dust make him sneeze.\n\n\"Humbly I come,\" he says, almost laughing, \"to speak to thee.\" Ikora said this was the place. Io. A world still half-born, connected as if by an untorn umbilical to the Traveler. \"I wanted to say… thank you.\"\n\nHe finds he's looking up at Jupiter. He's accustomed to seeing the Traveler above the City, so he fastens on the nearest huge floating sphere as a proxy. He forces his eyes down to the soil again. \"Thank you for what you did to Ghaul.\"\n\nIkora tells him if you listen with the right ears, you can hear the Traveler's last conversation with Io. As if the matter of terraforming an entire moon with Earthlike gravity and a biosphere is only a matter of rhetoric and instruction. Well. Isn't that the challenge, in the end? Not just assembling the power to do something, but convincing people to do it? No, not even that—not convincing or coercing (Traveler knows he is tempted sometimes), but teaching them how to think as you think, how to value what you value, even giving them the ethics required to understand your valuation. So that you can trust them to make the choices you would, even when you're not around to father them.\n\nZavala wishes he were half as good a teacher as he is a Titan. Then maybe he could allow himself to relax a little and let others take care of things.\n\nExcept last time he let his guard down—last time he dared think they were triumphant, with Oryx repelled, SIVA contained, Vex befuddled, Cabal huddled in their bunkers and too stubborn to come out—Ghaul turned up in a storm and nearly destroyed the City, the Traveler, and everything Zavala loves.\n\n\"Did I fail you?\" he asks the bone-coiled dirt. \"Am I… the reason you had to wake up? Because I couldn't stop Ghaul by myself?\"\n\nIn the giddiness of victory, he declared this their new Golden Age. But now he thinks he may have misunderstood the Traveler's awakening. He has always, he hopes, been a brave man. But he is almost too afraid to ask this next question. \"Is this just our next 'age of triumph'? Is something worse on the way?\"\n\nThe bruise where he head-butted the fossil throbs. History, Zavala once told someone, is a question of armor. How much can you survive and keep on living? More than this, more than what's hit them so far.\n\nBut how much more? And if the next escalation is a consequence of the Traveler's awakening, will it be Zavala's fault?\n\nDuty is a puzzle. The harder you work, the more it seems to weigh. That reminds Zavala of Basho, his favorite poet, and of the hot spring Basho once visited to see the Murder Stone, which killed birds and insects that came too near. He has a horrible idea of the Traveler as that stone, surrounded by buzzing flies all shaped like Ghosts…\n\n\"You're doing it again,\" his Ghost warns him. \"I know that expression.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Zavala says. \"I just worry.\"",

Money and the promise of money and the things money can make people do. Knives. Pistols. Danger like static charge.\n\n\"He's no good for you,\" she says, \"and he's no good for me. If you turn him over, I'll be happy. You like me happy, don't you, Spider?\"\n\nThe Spider grumbles. \"Very well. You will take him alive? He must have stores of Ether, and no matter what Variks says, that Ether is mine…\"\n\nHe's agreed. She has what she came for, which is proof that the Spider actually wants this capture to succeed. As Regent, she can never tell when she succeeds. She's constantly reacting, making decisions that will only be clearly assessed by historians. Here, she is the Wrath again. She feels brave.\n\n\"We'll deal with the Ether once we have him. Thank you for the information.\" Petra slides the hood over her head and dismisses herself back into the crowd.\n\nTwo Dregs barter salvage with tokens like fingernail-sized knives. Slatted light falls through thick clouds of adulterated Ether to cut hard lines across the torn bannerless fringes some of the Fallen wear. A Cabal deserter, hunched against the wall in a baggy pressure sac, sells the location of Red Legion arms caches for lodes of raw Glimmer. Petra pauses for a moment on the threshold; looks back longingly at the chaos within; wishes that anything would happen to make her stay.\n\nShe goes out into the shadows of the surface.\n\nSoon, as clear as the visions that sometimes come to her, she knows there's something moving quick and stealthy up ahead. She keeps her pace steady. Checks her knife and pistol.\n\n\"So few of us remain, Petra Venj.\"\n\nThe voice betrays a bearing, and she catches just a glimpse of structure against the background noise: the hood of a cloak, the arch of lips.\n\n\"Who's there?\" she challenges.\n\nIt's a man. His movements are erratic, shrouded in arrhythmic noise that mimics the chaos of nature. He knows how to seem like an accidental thing: a tumbled heap, a brush of wind.\n\n\"Petra… if only we could go back to those days before…\"\n\n\"Uldren?\" she gasps. He is here! He has come to take the Regency and execute his sister's will! She'll be free again to act, act without cruel deliberation and agonizing uncertainty, free to meet every challenge instead of making them for herself—\n\nNo. This must be an illusion. It's too much of everything she wants. She searches with senses beyond sight for something capable of casting this into her mind. A Psion Flayer? A Hive Wizard?\n\n\"She trusted you with all of this, all of us. And you gave it to the 'mercy' of the Light.\"\n\nShe feels the intent to murder, and she knows it is meant for her. She draws and acquires the target faster than a sound can cross from mind to tongue—but her sight picture captures only darkness.\n\nTwo slow heartbeats. When no shot or knife comes, she begins to withdraw.\n\nNothing follows her to her ship.",

Keratinized skin gives way to toughened callus, ugly with bruising and overstressed veins.\n\nHe spreads his palm against his chest and holds it there, as if covering it up will make it go away.

I am trying to chronicle trillions of star systems at once, searching for a single planet. A faceless companion asks why I look so sad, and I show her a photo of a globular mass or a dual-ringed planet, depending on how you hold it. \"How much did you pay for that?\" she asks. \"Everything I have,\" I respond. Then the stars stop streaking and the ship crumbles apart. We fall into nothing, and I awake.\n\nFISSURING WARMTH: I am running from an encroaching burn of blue light. I jump from rock to rock, as they are the only things with gravity. Every leap is a battle against the cold nothingness of space. I see a sea of people gathered together, and realize that's where I am trying to go. I make one more giant leap, but the blue burn catches my ankles, and I fall. The impact of my plummet shatters the rock in two. Hundreds of these beings fall into the chasm I created behind me. I try to heave each of them back to the surface, and I do until I can't anymore. My elbows won't bend; my arms are too weak to push. The descent gets warmer and warmer until all goes black, and I awake.\n\nSONGS OF ANALYSIS: I am outside my body watching it float from one shapeless void into another. The first void contains a voice humming a tune, yet no presence. As I pass through each, one by one, another voice joins in harmony. I try counting the voices, but I am not sure if I should be adding or subtracting as they fade into one, and in my confusion I lose any memory of numbers at all. I feel a tether pulling me back into being and see myself waving goodbye. A voice burrows into my mind as the serenading songs become discordant, ugly. The voice becomes louder, and I awake.\n\nWASHING SKIN: I have gathered my belongings in a gray porcelain sink. The soap clings to my fingers. As I wash what I possess, my things begin to dissolve. I scrub harder because I know that the washing is a way to remove impurity, and I must be certain that I will not dissolve too. My mother tells me that silver is the element of false-life, blue skin poison. I worry that my fingernails are soft.\n\nMOUNTAIN: I am on the mountain at Felwinter's Peak, except there is an express monorail to my neighborhood grocery in the City, which is all out of what I need.

This reminds her too much of that awful day.\n\nSo when the voice comes through the door, she calls, \"Hold.

May I come in?\"\n\n\"You're not alone,\" she shouts back.\n\n\"I have my retinue with me.\"\n\nA few of Dinna's people lower their weapons. \"Weapons up,\" she snaps. \"We can't trust him to—\"\n\nRoyal overrides slither through the throne room's networks. The doors open, and a dazzling barrage of flashbangs plays the royal welcome. Dinna stares straight into it, weapon aimed, eyes open, trusting her helmet to buffer her sight—and waiting for the first blue flash of Fallen weapons.\n\nPrince Uldren Sov saunters in like the belle of the ball, his cocked revolver aimed at the ceiling. \"At ease,\" he says, with a little swish of his cloak, and everyone, Dinna included, responds. Just a moment's weakness. Just the subtlest flicker of deference, because he is the Prince and it feels so right to have royalty in this throne room again. Fingers off triggers, weapons skewed a few degrees off target—\n\nThe impulse is so strong because it jives with Dinna's discipline, which has already stepped in to crush the immediate instinct to blow Uldren away. Something's wrong. Something's off.\n\nBaseline Humans can react to a visual stimulus in less than two hundred milliseconds. Awoken, less than a hundred. But there is a phenomenon Dinna and every other Royal Guard knows well, a trick of the mind called attentional blink. You are waiting for something to appear: a hostile, a gunshot, a loud noise. When it does appear, your attention blinks. You cannot detect a second event if it comes just after the first.\n\nSo it is with the blue flash of Arc-rifle fire behind Uldren's cloak.\n\nIt could go differently, still. But there is no one in this room who can easily sight in and fire on their Prince—and he has no such reciprocal inhibition.",

He had a Ghost. He was touched by the Light. His motivations, though, were his own—some might say selfish, and I'd have to agree. In regard to the concepts of duty and devotion and using one's gifts for the betterment of humanity? Not his play. The City be damned. The Traveler be damned. The Light be damned.\n\n\"Which makes his run to the Tower and his newfound benevolence all the more… curious.\n\n\"I lost track of him when the Traveler fell silent.

I can't say it doesn't make me uneasy.\n\n\"There was—so we're clear—a time I'd call him a threat. There was a time I'd look to end him as punishment for the paths he'd tread.

He laughed at that, got comfortable. Got all kinds of open about where he'd been, what he was haulin'. Even dropped a tip on where an old friend of mine was hiding. I still wonder if he knows who I really am.\n\n\"He told me he left the system as soon as he was risen. Not immediately, sure. Had to get his bearings, find a ship—get it fit, get it flying. But soon as, he was good as gone. 'Drawn to the outer,' he says. I can appreciate.\n\n\"He says he's seen the deep side of Jupiter. Been to the Core Mines of Saturn. Name drops old myths no one's heard—the Luvial Crux, the Shift Chasms Below Elios, the Fourth Tomb of Nezarec. Goes on about the Idols of Lower Sul, the Treasure of Exodus Prime, the Solar Engine of Dead Star-Six.\n\n\"I think he's making most of it up, but he's got relics and etchings. He's got materials not of this system—odd metals, obsidian flames, thought engines, edible null cakes and a stuffed something that looks like a rabbit bio-fused with a cephalopod. He keeps all this stuff to himself—his 'gets,' he calls 'em.\n\n\"If they're for show, they put on a great one. But to what end? The clutter of oddities he's got ship-side ain't nothin' compared to what he's haulin'—that big, black mass of nothing you ain't ever seen before.\n\n\"He calls it an 'artifact,' but it's more than that. Just don't know what, exactly. He said he got far out as he's ever been. Said it was from a place cold enough to snuff out your Light. I ask him, was it Vex? Hive? Cagey as all, he said no, it was just 'other,' and it was powerful… maybe.\n\n\"That was his qualifier: 'maybe.'\n\n\"Why the hell bring it to the inner system then? 'Maybes' are trouble. But he's got an answer for everything. He says…\n\n\"'Brother… maybes are where the real treasure hides.'\n\n\"He could tell I wasn't satisfied, but I knew he wasn't lying. The chunk was 'other' for sure, and Ghost said its readings were off the charts, but abstract—unlike anything anyone had encountered.\n\n\"Can't say that made me comfortable, but then the Drifter, with his easy manner and eager charm, asked if I'd ever met a man in black named Callum.\n\n\"He was clearly changin' the subject, but he was lucky enough—or smart enough—to pick one I had interest in, and I could respect that.\"\n\n—A Renegade's Observations of a Drifter",

But that… that is what my Guardian wanted.\n\nHis name is Cyrell; and Cyrell called me Strain. I found him on the far edges of Mercury, in a valley that the Vex transformation had never reached. He seemed resilient, unwavering, old, and wise. I'd searched so long for my better half that I didn't hesitate. If I had considered but one moment more, I might have sensed how tired and burdened and tangled his soul truly was, and I would have left him in peace. And I would not be a murderer of my kin.\n\nCyrell told me we came to the Reef in search of Awoken. He had heard stories of how this far-flung offshoot of Humanity had returned to Sol with unparalleled knowledge. He believed they had the answer to a question he refused to share. I know now, however, that he really came here to spare me.\n\nHe confessed he could not bear another battle nor fight in the name of something no one could possibly understand. Though he could not remember his past, he knew deep down that he had already fought his last war.\n\nHe couldn't kill me. I was his friend. He doesn't kill friends. He wouldn't kill himself, either; that was cowardly, weak. And if the Ghosts' sole purpose was to raise the dead to kill in the name of unexplainable forces, he could no longer let that happen.

She looks around, taking in the human carnage surrounding her.\n\nShe thinks back to their arrival into this village. How its population lauded him and showered him with gifts, begged him to stay, to defend them, to keep them safe.\n\nAt first he seemed reluctant, but the longer he remained, and the more Fallen he slew, the more they praised him. That praise emboldened him; he grew expectant, addicted to their exaltations and gifts.\n\nThe more he consumed, the more the village's resources dwindled. He led expeditions to take from others—no warning, no diplomacy. He showed his might as one of the Risen and demanded he be lauded as savior. Those he once protected now died under his charge, and they venerated him all the more for it.\n\nAs much as she tried to guide him back into the Light and remind him why he was Chosen, he could not hear her over the adulations of his newfound vassals. Resurrection after resurrection, his legend flourished while the dead remained dead; he grew ever more covetous and unforgiving. He stopped learning from his losses and came to feel entitled to his immortality.\n\nOne winter night, clad in golden armor, he made war on a seaside settlement of fishers and spiritualists. Not a man, woman, or child survived. Flushed with the high of easy victory, he and his followers were ill prepared for the Fallen war party that had been stalking them the last few moons. It was a massacre atop a massacre. And only he, one of the Risen, would walk away from this.\n\nShe looks away from the human carnage surrounding her. Looks down upon the one she chose.

Osiris and Ikora would talk for hours—days, sometimes—and frankly, it was pretty boring. Especially when I got stuck entertaining Ophiuchus. Seriously, that Ghost is not a conversationalist.\n\nAnyway, O said he had a theory why there was one Ghost for one Guardian. He thought that each of us had strengths that complemented weaknesses in our Guardian, and vice versa. That we needed to be together, or neither of us would be whole.\n\n\"Like soul mates?\" I asked. \"Because I'm not in love with Osiris or anything. Not only would that be really weird, he kinda gets on my nerves a lot of the time.\"\n\n\"It is not a romantic attachment,\" O said. If he had eyes, he would have rolled them at me. \"It is my belief that the Traveler understood that normal people would not be enough to protect humanity. That it would take those who are extraordinary in both body and spirit. And that only by the merging of Ghost and Guardian into a single unit could this be accomplished.\"\n\n\"I don't know where Ikora keeps you,\" I told him, \"but Osiris and I are not 'a single unit.' You've heard us argue. A lot.\"\n\n\"And why do you challenge him?\" O asked.\n\n\"Because no one else will. He's the great and powerful Osiris: hero, scholar, savior, yadda yadda. And no one, I mean no one, not even Ikora, really challenges him. They do what he wants, even if it's a terrible idea. Not me.\n\n\"Everyone needs someone to tell them to get over themselves once in a while. Especially Osiris.\"\n\n\"Would you say that is a strength that complements a weakness?\"\n\nI didn't answer. I hate it when someone else is right. Good thing it doesn't happen often.\n\n\"All right then, smarty Ghost,\" I finally said. \"What about you and Ikora? You're both rigid and stuffy, read too much…\"\n\n\"I am a calming influence. I encourage her to think before she acts and not to let her emotions get the best of her.\"\n\nI couldn't help it. I cracked up. It actually took me a minute to get under control. \"Ikora?\" I said, laughing so hard I could barely talk. \"Have you met Ikora? All she does is think!\"\n\n\"You don't know her at all,\" Ophiuchus told me.",

He boarded the derelict Almighty with his fireteam, hoping to salvage Cabal secrets from the star murderer.\n\nI should have seen the trap. Was it Cabal? Was it some Vex infection from Mercury? I don't know. It's all my fault. I remember how the moment of activation felt like falling. He lunged for the center, crying out to his friends, \"I'll disarm it!\"\n\nHe is still lunging. Fly to the Almighty and you will find him there, caught in the amber of slow time, reaching forever. I have observed his motions carefully. He will arrive at the mechanism and deactivate the trap in only a little more than fifty thousand years.\n\nI cannot resurrect him. I have tried so hard. The City's Warlocks and thanatonauts answered all my desperate questions, even when I began to ask if he could be destroyed. At least if he were gone, unmade, then I could make him again…\n\nWhy can't I bring him back? If a Guardian falls into Titan's methane sea, they do not die instantly, but we can still bring them back on the arcology. If a Guardian hurls themself off their ship into space, do we need to wait for them to disintegrate in the solar wind before we bring them back? No. No. It was never hard before! I see him right there, and he seems so close! All I was ever meant to be was his Ghost!\n\nBut all Ghosts know there are places where we cannot bring our Guardians back to life. And this is one of them. Why? Is the Darkness gathered against us here? Is the Light too weak?\n\nI think I know why. Some share my theory. What do we do when we bring our Guardians back? What is the magical heart of the process? Are we like the City's probability kilns, twisting the quantum vacuum in our favor to yield matter?\n\nPerhaps. Perhaps. But certain members of a cult I shall not directly name have their own specific interpretation of this process. \"When you bring him back,\" they told me, \"you must have a template… an image to provide you with the information you need. Where do you find that template?\n\n\"Simply in a neighboring timeline. A place where he is still alive and intact. And wherever there is great danger, wherever the probability of death is too high, then those timelines become scarce and hard to reach. And so you find the zones where Guardians cannot easily be remade.\"\n\nIf this is true, then I am doomed and free. There will be no alternate worlds in which my Guardian escapes that trap. There will be no hope of resurrection.\n\nI will be a Ghost alone.\n\nBut the thought haunts me that I might be wrong, and that he is still waiting for me…",

The few survivors were huddled close in the dark of a cave, muffling their heavy, quick breaths, stifling their sobbing.\n\nWhen I found them, many nights before, I also found renewed purpose. I had traveled these dead and dying worlds for longer than I cared to remember, all the while in search of a spark worthy of ignition.\n\nOver time I'd grown weary, but in this small band of survivors, I found hope. If I couldn't find a lost soul worthy to be touched by the Light, then I would find another way, a smaller way, to be of service. I would lead this small gathering of desperate men, women, and a single child to the growing sanctuary beneath the Traveler.\n\nIf I could not find a hero to challenge the Darkness, I would be a guide to those in need of salvation.\n\nIt took some time to gain their trust. I was odd—other. They thought I was an angel. I told them I was not. They named me Tiānshǐ. I did not object.\n\nThe child marveled at me. Still too young to speak, much less comprehend, he had a presence that was a burden and a boon. His parents did all they could to nurture him, protect him with the aid, comfort, and care of their traveling companions—once strangers, now bound deeper than blood by their shared experience in this new life after the end of the world.\n\nOn that day, in that cave, huddled in fear as the Fallen Skiff's roar faded over the tree line, the mother wailed—a sound I had never before heard and hope never to hear again.\n\nSuch pain. Such sorrow.\n\nGrief. Suffering. Loss.\n\nHer cry echoed through the forest. Her husband, weeping and on the edge of breaking down, simply held her.\n\nAnd the dead child in her arms.\n\nThe others tried to calm them, out of fear that the Fallen would return. The attack had been swift and brutal. Twenty dead. Only nine survivors, here, in this cave. I watched the tree line, anxious and afraid.\n\nThe mother's pain filled the space between the thick trees. I turned back to her and saw it for the first time: the child's spark.\n\nFaint. But there.\n\nThis little boy was not my charge. Those selected to return were champions. This child was so small, so frail. What devotion had he shown? What bravery? What had he sacrificed? But a thought lingered…\n\nWas it not my purest purpose to deliver hope? Every hero raised fought not for themselves but for the whole of humanity. If saving one life—if redressing this one terrible loss—was not a worthy cause… what was?\n\nI watched the mother as she cried.\n\nI felt myself expand. Felt the Light that was me intensify. In a way, it was outside of my control, as if something had reached inside of me and flipped a switch. A beam erupted from my core and bathed with Light the child's small, broken body.\n\nA second passed—\n\nAnd he began to cry. All fell silent. The Traveler's gift had been given. A child, returned. And with him, the beginning of my journey's end.\n\nDid I do the right thing? Would the child grow to reach his peak physical self? Would he, like all returned, be ready for the wars to come?\n\nBut then a thought came over me, one I had never before considered: maybe death would have been better.\n\nHad I saved the child, or doomed him?\n\nAs his cries echoed, the survivors looked on in shock. There was joy in their silence—wonder.\n\nI looked down on him, and pride began to well inside of me. I had done what was right.\n\nBut that was then—only months ago, but long enough to seem a lifetime.\n\nNow the Fallen are back, and we are running. And I fear the promise of a gift given is far from enough to save us from a pirate's blade.\n\n—Fragment of the last transmission from an unknown Ghost",

Instinct, as it turns out, is a compelling motivator. She was up in a flash, sprinting away from the rig's burners and away from the gnashing teeth that were quick on her heels. As soon as she cleared the rig, the Cabal opened fire. And here's where risk became reward…\n\nMy Guardian didn't flinch. Didn't cower. Instead, she got angry. And aggressive.\n\nThis long-dead woman was back among the living for only a moment, and already she was one with war. I wonder, perhaps, if that's what makes humanity the perfect weapon—if that's what makes it a force worthy of concern. Not my place to say. Though what came next gave me pause and more than a hint of pride.\n\nMy Guardian charged the nearest Cabal—a creature of war she had never seen, a hulking brute in thick-plated armor.\n\nShe docked and dodged, left to right and back again to avoid slug fire. A War Beast lunged, clamping its jaw on my Guardian's forearm. She yelled.\n\nThe Cabal laughed. The other War Beasts closed in.\n\nThen…\n\nMy Guardian—this woman only just reborn in the Light—grabbed the Beast clamping down on her arm by the hind legs, Lifted, and brought her entire weight down on the creature's spine, knee first.\n\nThe sound—cracked bone and a sudden, sharp yelp—caused the other Beasts to halt and the Cabal to quell their laughter.\n\nShe resumed her charge. No hesitation. The Beast's limp body was still locked on her arm. She pulled it free—I could hear the flesh tear, but she did not flinch. Instead she closed the distance, rushing the Cabal, the Beast held tight in her good arm's grip.\n\nThe Cabal raised his weapon, but too late. The other Beasts charged as my Guardian pummeled the Legionary with the corpse of his pet. It was brutal, swift.\n\nI issued a warning as the War Beasts lunged, but it didn't matter—she already had the Cabal's slug thrower in hand.

They relish the slaughter.\n\nI was guiding our ragtag group through dense woods, but with a child to carry and many survivors wounded, we didn't move quickly enough.

But they are smart and caring; they have courage but know when to run, when to survive. They will stay hidden until the Fallen are away, my Light serving as a distraction to lure them as far from these Humans as I can.\n\nI made my presence known to the pirates and darted from the last of the survivors—made myself a target to buy them time. But that time is short.\n\nThe Fallen are close now. And closing. I can hear the bark of their war cries. I can feel the spark of their blades. They've long since learned that to kill one like me is a future problem solved.\n\nI am not sorry for the choice I made. The child gave hope, though fleeting. What comes next for him is unknown. But there is promise in him, should he find sanctuary. Should he find guidance.\n\nThis is not a confession. This is my hope. This is my—\n\n—Fragment of the last transmission from an unknown Ghost",

Over time he… distanced himself—stood out.\n\nIt took some time for her to adjust to his personality. From what she's shared, it took him time as well. The Cayde-6 known to all is not the man he was in total. His wit and his playfulness were a shield—a weapon as trained as his blade or his hand cannons.\n\nHe called her Sundance. I was never sure why. She said it was from an old legend—a fable from the time before the time before. I always thought it was because of her spark, the grace with which she moved—so effortless, so sly. They were a perfect match.\n\nThere's no doubt he recounted his return to those closest to him on more than one occasion; and there's no doubt as well that the events shifted a bit with each telling. Like his wit, the building of his legend was a weapon.\n\nFor those who don't know… For those who were not lucky enough to hear the tale of Cayde-6's first from his own mouth—with that charm and the way he'd act out his favorite parts, complete with sound effects—here is one telling…\n\nIt's a recording from cycles past. It's not the whole story, but where Cayde-6 was involved, nothing ever was…\n\n\"BOOM! I wake up. Groggy. Confused. Hungover. It's the same for us all, so that initial shock's nothing new. Sundance is in my face, and I'm freaking out. My brain works, but I don't remember a thing 'cept that I seem to be a functioning life form—I'm human, I'm a man. And then my mind starts reeling a thousand miles a minute. BOOM-BOOM-BOOM. Like I'm downloading the 'Idiot's Guide to Basic Human Existence.' Cool. Great. Still can't remember anything. And I sure can't wrap my head around the talking, floating magic robot orb-thing jabbering in my face. I'm freaked. So, I freaked. Smacked her to the ground. Hard… And I ran.\n\n\"I'm runnin'. She's runnin'… Or, ya know, whatever she's doin' since she doesn't have any legs… She's right behind me, going, 'Wrong way! Wrong way!' She's screaming. I'm screaming. Whatever she's yelling, I just keep running. It's night. Did I mention that? It's nighttime and my eyes are still adjusting. So, I'm runnin', I'm runnin'. Can't see. Can't remember. Scared to death. Confused as all get-out. And then—\n\n\"I fall. I'm straight up falling. Just like that, I ran… Right. Off. A. Cliff. It wasn't a short drop. I bounced… so many times. Felt each and every one. Till I didn't. Till it all went black again. And then…\n\n\"BOOM! I'm back! She got me right up on my feet. Just like she always does. And that, my dudes, was the start of a beautiful friendship.\"\n\nMost haven't heard that story, and in listening, you hopefully weren't looking for any definitive truth of who he was as a man or a Guardian. That's not what the story's for. Its purpose, now more than ever, fits nicely into the armor Cayde wore best…\n\nHe thought it was funny. And now, more than ever…\n\nCayde would want us to laugh.\n\n—Shiro-4's Ghost, at a gathering in Cayde-6's honor",

        "description": "I am quiet, I am not here, the Fallen cannot see me, they cannot know me. I am not a shadow, but I move among them, silent, deliberate of motion, and intent as when I entered their hollow one month prior. I used the light of day to mask my own, because the forest here is barren, it's, it's, it's a dead place, to and fro, a constant buzz as the scavengers go about the business of stripping this world of its old glories. And I watch, I learn, I record and preserve; their every movement is my obsession. I hang on their every word, even though I am not versed in their nightmare tongue, but others are and they will decipher it; they will find the secrets hidden within. Secrets are like weapons, and I am an instrument of their unmaking. They are enemy, they are cruel, and I will learn and share, and they will be undone.\n\nWhat is that shouting? I am deep now, no telling how far in. I have tracked each meter. Mapped every path. But this maze is ever-winding and their cheers now echo, violent with joy, and I hesitate to investigate as I am entering unknown corridors thick with security… Yes, yes, this is a special place, a holy place, a mechanized place, and the shouts merge with screams and the grinding of gears, and the joy joins with pain. There is suffering here, punishment—a, a… a ritual? I must know so we may know, and I move slow, careful… must… not… be seen… cannot be detected… Meter by meter, anywhere where cover is provided. Quick and with purpose whenever exposed. I make my way, leaving other avenues unexplored; the cheers must be understood. But eventually they die. Replaced by the harmony of the pirates' busy days and nights, oh my how they never rest—or rather… when they rest, others continue the work, prepping scavenger sorties, sifting through spoils, readying their fleet, their weapons, their worship. The manner in which they revere machines, I should feel safe here, I should be among their gods… Am I machine? I don't know, I don't know anything. Their worship is not so simple. With the cacophony of excitement no longer echoing, I slow my pace but remain vigilant in my efforts to locate its origin.\n\nIt is weeks before I do, weeks before now. A ceremony has just ended and I am sending out a recollection of what I have seen, because I am seen—these are my final moments, of this I am sure. The ceremony is combat, ritual, and fury, it is a pit and arena where the lesser and unworthy must prove their value or suffer and die. Oh how they fight dirty, oh how they fight to survive—or to thrive. In this pit, before the eyes of an Archon, shamed Eliksni may redeem themselves, lesser pirates may improve their station: a Dreg to a Vandal, a Vandal to a Captain, a Captain to… This is their forge, their place of judgment, their trial before their betters. This is what we are up against; kill or die, thrive or perish, they have no use for the weak and they watch and cheer and scream as their Archon looks on. But I have become careless. The fervor became a distraction and now the Archon's eyes have found me and I am too deep to run and I think he is smiling…\n\n—The last frantic transmissions of Wren, a brave Ghost of the spectral network",

        "description": "Peregrine Institute of Higher Learning Presents:\n\n\"Ghost Stories: Interviews with Two Ghosts of the Traveler\"\n\nA guest lecture by two Guardian-less Ghosts about life, Light, and the search for their Guardians\nFeaturing: Balthazar (unpartnered) and Peach (unpartnered)\n\nTranscript of the Q&A session is as follows:\n\nQ: What is the Traveler, in your understanding?\n\nBALTHAZAR: Great question.\n\nPEACH: Terrible question.\n\nBALTHAZAR: In a sense, it's the ONLY question. The Traveler is our primary, our mother, the primordial and the pinnacle. A dear friend, the Ghost of Pujari, once compared the Traveler to a song that has never been sung—\n\nPEACH: Look, the answer no one likes to give is that no one knows what the Traveler is or anything about it. Not even us.\n\nBALTHAZAR: We know she wished for us to raise Guardians to be her avatars and defenders—\n\nPEACH: Do we, though? Just because we CAN do that doesn't mean we were MADE to do that. And who says it's a \"she\" anyway? Why does \"it\" need a gender?\n\nBALTHAZAR: The Traveler, in her omniscient wisdom, looked into the past and the future, and from all the generations that emerged from the cradle of Earth, she chose the best of them to be her champions. Each Ghost was lovingly and carefully created for their one true Guardian. The Ghost and Guardian complete each other.\n\nPEACH: If that's true, then the Traveler's kind of a jerk.\n\nBALTHAZAR: Excuse me?\n\nPEACH: Look, I know tons of Ghosts who died before they ever found their Guardians. I know some Ghosts who still haven't found a Guardian. You haven't. And I haven't, but I don't think I'm \"incomplete\" because of it.\n\nBALTHAZAR: I have the humility to recognize my own shortcomings and to submit myself to the Traveler's plan.\n\n\nQ: Do you remember being inside the Traveler?\n\nPEACH: No.\n\nBALTHAZAR: I do. We call it the Womb.\n\nPEACH: I have never and will never call it that.\n\nBALTHAZAR: Imagine a cosmos inside a bottle. Trillions of stars orbiting each other in a complex weave. But they aren't stars. Perhaps a better word would be… souls. Souls, dancing in an infinite space enclosed within a celestial egg.\n\nPEACH: Which is it, an egg or a womb?\n\nBALTHAZAR: It's called a metaphor.\n\nPEACH: Well then, pick a metaphor. Not twelve.\n\nBALTHAZAR: Well, what would you call it?\n\nPEACH: I wouldn't call it anything, because I don't remember it, and I don't think you do either.\n\n\nQ: Some people say that each Ghost is an aspect of the Traveler—that is to say, that each Ghost represents a part of the divine Whole.\n\nPEACH: [loud laughter]\n\nBALTHAZAR: Would you please? This is unbecoming.\n\nPEACH: First of all, that wasn't a question. Second of all… [more laughter] Third of all: if I'm a part of the Traveler's brain or soul or whatever, then the Traveler sure isn't divine, I'll tell you that much.\n\n\nQ: What will you do if you never find a Guardian?\n\nBALTHAZAR: I shall find a Guardian. The Traveler has willed it so.\n\nPEACH: Did you get that in writing?\n\nBALTHAZAR: It is true that some Ghosts die before finding their partners. If that happens to me, then I suppose I will \"do\" nothing, since I will no longer be. But I have faith.\n\nPEACH: If I never find my Guardian, I'll go steal someone else's. I hear Sagira had a good time with that.\n\n\nQ: If you could eat, what would you eat first?\n\nPEACH: Finally, a good question!\n\nBALTHAZAR: We do not know the desire for food. Our semicorporeal form—\n\nPEACH: Nectarines. Or hot sauce. Ooh, or crickets. Crunchy roasted crickets. Crunchy food sounds so fun. I wish I could get cricket carapace stuck between my teeth. Here's a question for YOU: what's it like to have teeth?\n\nBALTHAZAR: Is this over yet?",

Another of my little pack has found her partner, a Human male, and now the two of them are coming to you by watercraft over the Pacific. Keep an eye on this one, Tallu. He has taken the name Andal Brask, and I believe he will be trouble.\n\nPerhaps all this travel has made me sentimental, for when one of my Ghost wards finds their Guardian, I am sad, because my pack grows smaller. I miss them when they are gone. Now I am down to one Ghost other than my own. Pup, we call him. The runt of my metallic litter. Pup has yet to speak, but always his little blue eye searches for his Guardian.\n\nI plan to resupply at the Cosmodrome and then take Pup north. Those steppes are uncharted territory, except by that lone wolf, Conar. My correspondence with him is regular in the outbound direction; I consider myself lucky when he answers every fifth message. Still, you and I both know his intel is good. No one else knows Old Russia like he does.\n\nPerhaps in the Cosmodrome I will find a ship capable of breaking atmosphere. Though there is much of this Earth I have yet to see, I have come across more than a few Ghosts who believe their Guardians are offworld, waiting in the Golden Age ruins of Freehold and Ishtar and beyond. Some of these little Lights have decided to brave the null on their own to reach their fated partners. I tell them there's still so much of Earth we've yet to sniff out, that perhaps their Guardians have not yet been born, but some of them are convinced. If my next Ghost pack wants to make the journey, I am determined to join them.\n\nThese last few months we've enjoyed the pleasant absence of Cyrell. Now I feel more confident that we lost him in Australis. If he tries to hurt my Ghosts, I will rip his throat out.\n\nI hope you're not feeling too cooped up. You're still doing good work, Tallu. And as they say, better you than me.\n\nYour Faithful Den-Mother-of-Ghosts,\nMicah-10",

I don't know. I don't know that it matters. I have been searching since the day that I was born. I will take anyone.\n\nI crest a dune. The Gobi is endless in the evening light. And then I see it: a burnt-out building, the only man-made structure for miles. I do not know whether to fly faster or keep a stately pace. It doesn't matter. The dead cannot see.\n\nI am nervous. Why am I nervous?\n\nAs I draw closer, I rehearse what I might say. First introductions are important. \"You are a child of the Traveler's Light,\" I say to myself. \"You have been chosen in defense of this solar system… No. No. Hm. You… We are both children of the Traveler. You and I are both children of…\"\n\nI forget my words as I slip into the building. I find meteorological equipment. I find an empty office. I find a dingy breakroom. At the back of the breakroom, I see my other half: a Fallen Vandal crushed beneath a toppled refrigerator.\n\nI am devastated. I have seen the Fallen. They are butchers. Castaway murderers. I would take anyone, but not this. Not this thing.\n\nI turn away. I count seventeen slow laps around the room and then another four around the building. I should be decisive, shouldn't I? I should be filled with pride that I have fulfilled my first purpose. I am not. It doesn't matter. I cannot ignore the pull.\n\nI return to the breakroom. I do not know what I will say, but—Fallen or no—it is the Traveler's will that I do this. I reach toward the Light, then reach toward that pull to join them together.\n\nThe refrigerator trembles as the Light suffuses him. I hear a low groan. \"Push it away,\" I whisper. If my Risen dies beneath this refrigerator and I fly away into the sun, no one will know. Perhaps I will have done the Earth a great service. \"I'm here with you, but you must help yourself. Push it away and sit up.\"\n\nThe refrigerator shifts, then topples to the side. An Awoken man sits up and pushes the dead Vandal off his chest like an unwelcome blanket on a hot summer night. With effort, he wiggles free and stands straight.\n\n\n\n\"Who are you?\" he asks. He looks around, then down at his blue hands. \"What am I?\"\n\n\"I am your Ghost,\" I say with more than a hint of obvious relief. \"You are one of the Traveler's Chosen, a defender of humanity. What is your name?\"\n\nHe flexes his fingers, works his jaw, blows a raspberry. Then he looks at me. \"Savin. Yes, I think I call myself Savin.\" He nods, satisfied. \"Let's go, Yourghost.\"",

How does this have like three hundred comments?\" she says, flicking to the next page. \"Where's the juicy stuff?\"\n\n\"Hey, it's Pulled Pork,\" Agu says, peeking up over one of Nkechi's tremendous pauldrons.\n\nShe sits up right away, eyes lighting with interest. \"Really? Where?\"\n\nPulled Pork is the name they've given to a very sweet, very earnest Ghost that has been looking for his Guardian for about as long as they can remember. Pulled Pork is not his real name, but it feels right, like calling Mara Sov by her full name instead of just her forename.\n\nAgu directs Nkechi's attention out into the floating scrap. Sure enough, there he is: a tiny speck moving with meticulous patience across the surface of a blasted-out Fallen Skiff. \"Let's go say hi,\" Nkechi decides, disabling her VanNet HUD. She climbs to her feet and begins a lazy zero-gravity parkour run, leaping and drifting from one hunk of scrap to another.\n\n\"Hey, buddy!\" she calls when they get close. \"Whatcha doing?\"\n\nPulled Pork finishes up a scan of a floating piece of concrete and rebar, then turns toward them.\n\n\"I am looking for my Guardian!\" he chirps.\n\n\"That's nice. You gonna find him in that rock?\"\n\n\"You never know, Miss Nkechi Thirty-Two. Maybe my Guardian is very small.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" Nkechi agrees. \"But you might want to consider scanning the dead, bud. That shell's pretty snappy. Is it new?\" It's Reef-purple, with a flowerlike silhouette and silver detailing.\n\n\"Yes! It is. It was a gift. And, thank you for your suggestion. I have considered it! I do often scan the dead. I also scan other things. I like to be thorough.\" Pulled Pork bobs in place politely, almost bowing. \"Please excuse me one moment!\" He turns to scan a piece of warped plasteel.\n\nThey watch. Nkechi shakes her head.\n\n\"Oh, leave him alone,\" Agu whispers in her ear. \"If he goes through every bit of scrap in the Reef, he'll find someone eventually. Sky knows there are plenty of bodies (and body parts) floating around here…\"\n\n\"Yeah, we said that when we found him on Mars, and that was before Twilight Gap,\" Nkechi replies.\n\n\"Well. With that in mind, let's check back on him in a couple months. Who knows? Maybe he'll get lucky and find the greatest Guardian of all time.\"\n\n\"Shoot.

His quest was honorable… though, in the end, misguided. No, not in the end. Much sooner.\n\nThe flaw in his ambition became evident shortly after we crossed the western mire. At first I took his flights of fancy as playful enthusiasm—frivolous aggression free of consequence, a means of honing his focus and skill in advance of the dangers to come. But quickly, oh, so quickly, I found his mind was not in tune with reality. He was driven—pulled?—by his imagination.\n\nWhere any other would see the crippled ruins of an old-world crane—the snapped length of its long arm creaking in the breeze—he would see a demon, and in the cutting shrill of the swaying metal's cry he would hear a monster's ravenous shriek.\n\nHe had long talked of the adventures of his life past. \"I am an anomaly,\" he would decree, \"The lone Guardian whose past rings true, whose history is his guide.\"\n\nHe spoke about that dead life with such passion, in such detail, I not only wanted to believe… I did.\n\nBut as he charged the crane's age-poked carcass, I knew a truth that had haunted me since the carving of the Wicked Wood, some months gone: he was broken. His mind—unsettled. His truths—unfettered by fact, unbound by reality.\n\nHe had named the Wood, as he had the Howling Hills, the Dead Man's Crevasse, the Gorgon's Maze. All mundane landscapes marked as hazards to be conquered, enemies to be slain, as he weaved a mythic tale of his own grand—and as I would find, delusional—design.\n\nIn the Hills, he slaughtered wolves; he called them Hounds of Hell. In the Crevasse, he burned the remains of long-dead \"survivors\"; he called them Foot Soldiers of the Necro-King. Down in the Maze, he covered his tracks so that the Stone Mother would not—could not—follow.\n\nHe did all those things and none, because none of those things were true outside of his fraying mind. The wolves were simply rabid. The bones, no threat beyond a reminder of all we'd lost. The Maze? Just a canyon—one way in, one way out, a straight shot through.\n\nAs the crane fell and my Guardian issued his \"killing blow,\" he laughed and then turned to me. His eyes… I could see he was gone—the one I'd returned all those cycles past replaced by a hollow shell filled with madness.\n\nI do not know what broke him, or if he had ever been whole to begin with, but in that moment, as he spoke—the conquered husk of the Dragon of Summers' End, which wasn't really a dragon but simply a fragile old crane, lying defeated in his wake—I knew I would have to let him go… to end his slide into uncontrolled folly.\n\n\"Panza, old man,\" he started. \"The Dragon is gone, but he yielded his treasure to me in a whisper… A secret so dire it may just save us all.\" He leaned closer and said in a hushed voice, as if sharing a confidence, \"The Traveler is no gift—it is a lie… A beacon for death and destruction. Within be dragons, nurtured by our suffering, weaned on our hope. All dragons must die. The shell must be cracked till its yolk drowns those who worship its deceit. Our last great conquest. The crowning battle of our legend writ large.\" And then he shouted, \"For Light to endure, the Traveler must perish!\"\n\nHe was smiling. Confident. Manic.\n\nTwo days later he took a fall while challenging the Mountain Troll of Gallows Rock. It was a boulder. There was no troll. It crushed him. And though it caused me great pain—still to this day—\n\nI did not return him. How could I?\n\nHis diseased imagination would surely doom us all.\n\n—Panza, lamenting the unfortunate necessity of leaving his Guardian to remain unreturned",

The light from the monitors was the only illumination in the room as his arms flew across the controls.\n\nRelaying warnings to Petra and the Awoken. He could already see the remainder of the Awoken fleet disappearing off his scopes, going into hiding.\n\nRelaying warnings to the City, though he could see he was far too late.

As the Great Machine was yoked, as the Guardians… fell.\n\nScrambling, he alerted the Crows… but something went wrong. The network had fallen dark—each and every Crow offline. All, that is, save for one. Through a garbled image he saw a hand, an Awoken hand, but it almost immediately fell to static. He wanted to care. He wanted to feel something for them. What dominated his thoughts, though—what made a ticking noise emanate deep in his voice synth—was the growing fear that the Queen's plan had failed.\n\nHe sat back in his chair.

Nearby, Petra drummed her fingers along the hilt of her knife; her eyes glinted with envy.\n\nShe held onto this prison as if it was the last thing she could control. Perhaps it was. Between the scattered remnants of the Red Legion and the Scorned Barons running rampant through the Reef, the Awoken had little left to call their own.\n\nThere was little left of the Awoken.\n\nVariks sighed. Only a true Kell understood that survival was not a game of waiting.

Now their terror was spreading throughout the Reef with more and more Fallen answering the Barons' anarchistic call.\n\nShe was right about one thing though: He could stand to increase his intake. The thought of it made Variks thirsty for the flow. Like all of his kind since the appearance of the Red Legion, he had been forced to ration his intake. He'd never felt so weak, so close to death.

They began with the one thing their people needed to survive: Ether. In a way, the Barons had become heads of a new House, priests in their own rites, and arbiters of their own trials.\n\nThe terror they unleashed had almost grown as powerful as any Kell. These heathens were not Eliksni; they were more \"Fallen\" than any of their brethren.

She used stolen Cabal telemetry and gravity traps to sabotage vessels, relieve them of their cargo, and haul the hulks back to their own shipyard chop shops.\n\nPirrha the Blind, the Ghost of Hellrise Cavern, who haunted the Baron's territory with phantom decoys and ended all trespassers from the shadows.\n\nReksis Vahn, the Godslayer, the Hangman.

Now he had doubt.\n\nHis goal had always ever been a simple one. The banner of House Judgment, the calling to which he had been born. Keep his people together.\n\nWith the Light now streaming across the system and nothing to show for it—no Queen, no Eris or Osiris, and no sign the Great Machine remembered the Eliksni—what was there to look forward to?

Mulling his options, his information. His secrets.\n\nSecrets had protected the House of Judgment. The more knowledge one could obfuscate, the more significant one became. Secrets bred possibility. Secrets bred… sway.\n\nBut Judgment, true Judgment, required hierarchy. And Eliksni hierarchy died with the fall of the Houses. The Guardians had picked them apart, Kell by Kell, Prime by Prime. Now, there was all but nothing left of his culture—only pirates and scavengers and lone wolves like the days before the Edge Wars. No trust, no honor, no way to be… necessary.\n\nYet one final hope among the Eliksni still thrived. Craask, Kell of Kings. The Kings understood Judgment, for together they ended the Edge Wars in their people's golden age. Craask. His last hope to see his dreams of a united Eliksni made manifest. He must make contact.\n\nAnd so he hired a bounty hunter named Groks to find Craask and remind them of their need for one another. Groks is emblematic of all that Variks despises in his people—gluttonous, proud, and in it only for himself. When they spoke, Groks made Variks pay with a litany of insults.\n\nVariks the Slip. Variks the Beggar. Variks the Kell-Maker. But it was all for show. Groks would work; and it came for a mere four bales of Etheric Helix and a promise to keep him free of the Prison of Elders. The deal struck, Groks burst out in hysterical laughter.\n\n\"Ha! Consider job done, Slip!\" Groks spoke in a low form of Eliksni, the only reason Variks employed him. \"You have grown desperate with your 'Kell' gone. Have you not heard?\"\n\nVariks sighed.\n\n\"King Kell is gone, Kell-Maker. Dead at the hands of that insane Archon, Fikrul, and some Awoken vagabond he calls 'Father.' What remains of the Kings huddles now in the dead zones of Earth, under the shadow of the Great Machine's Shard. I expect my four bales in—\"\n\nVariks killed the feed. The last link in the great Eliksni chain was broken. If there were any who called themselves Kell out there, they would not know Variks, Judgment, or the laws that governed the Houses. The scattered children of the Whirlwind were dead.\n\nBut… Fikrul survived Cayde and his Six? Groks was a lot of things, but he was not a liar. If Fikrul was alive and strong enough to kill Craask… And who was this Awoken vagabond of which Groks spoke? His mind reeled. So long as Fikrul lived, the Reef was not safe. He scrambled through his comm channels, searching for the right connection.\n\n\"Master Cayde. Variks requests to meet you regarding your deal with Petra, a job undone.\"",

Not unless you want to lose your last two real arms. We're done. Get. You're bad luck.\" The Hunter stood, made to leave.

Cayde's eyebrows went up in surprise.\n\n\"A gift of trust. Memento of the Reef. Upgraded, yes? Very deadly.\"\n\nThe Hunter Vanguard tried to hide his excitement. \"Is. Uh. Is that the last one? I haven't seen one of those in…\"\n\n\"One of the last. Not many left.\" Variks' voice was even, calm.\n\nCayde snatched the weapon from the table.

Unbidden, memories rushed past him. All he could do was hang on as the last days of the Eliksni played out in his mind.\n\nHe and his fellow scribes passing Judgment in their soft, furred robes. Then the Whirlwind, the Elders torn apart, the pillaging of the House. Variks, kneeling before a window, staring up at the Great Machine. Watching it vanish. The long journey in the darkness.\n\nHis flight to run with the Wolves, his pleas to Skolas. The pact with Fikrul to sever Kaliks Prime and secret it away. The Prime vanishing… And again Fikrul, on the horizon, preparing to give the Fallen what they so rightfully deserve…\n\nTHERE IS ONLY ONE PATH LEFT FOR YOU HERE, IN A PLACE WHERE EVERYTHING DIES…\n\n…AND BEGINS ANEW.\n\nWith that, a new power burned, affording him the strength to rise again. Judgment cast—\n\nThe screaming pulse of the prison alarms stirred Variks awake.\n\nOn the comms, he heard Petra's voice. Cayde had returned.",

Perhaps Cayde had finally found Fikrul—and for that, Variks would need every drop of strength he could muster.\n\nHis strides were long and slow as he allowed the Ether to course through him, his posture growing taller and more commanding with each step. At the top of the maxsec wing, his hands flew over the controls. He prepared the two empty cells and ordered extraction Servitors into place, all the while reveling in the thought of the judgment of Fikrul. Finished, he stepped back and waited.\n\nSnarling, yelling, the prisoners entered the wing. One, an Eliksni, Petra shoved hard into one of the two cryo-cells. The Fallen landed, weak, and Petra sealed the cell door.\n\nVariks was all too pleased to see the hulking, disgraced Fikrul—the lifeline of the Scorned Barons, his once trusted co-conspirator and great betrayer—seething as the extraction Servitors whirred to life, sapping the heretical Archon of his precious Ether. Variks and Fikrul looked deep into one another's eyes, centuries of history passing between them in the space of a heartbeat.\n\nFikrul laughed.\n\nUnnerved, Variks stepped away as Cayde dragged a ragged, humanoid figure—head bagged, face unseen. Cayde unceremoniously tore off the hood and tossed the humanoid—an Awoken man—into the open cell.\n\n\"And stay there!\" Cayde said. His joke fell flat.\n\nOn hands and knees, the stranger looked up at his captors to reveal a familiar mess of crow-black hair, blue skin, and piercing yellow eyes.\n\n\"Variks…\"\n\nIt was the face of Uldren Sov—brother to the Queen, prince of the Awoken, and heir to the Reef.",

Variks looked back to Petra.\n\n\"Petra Venj… I—I do not understand.\"\n\n\"I know. It's… Something's wrong with him, Variks. He's… mad. Lock him down—lock down the entire cellblock. No one in but you or me. Speak of this to no one. As far as the system is concerned, Uldren Sov died over Saturn.\"\n\nVariks looked to Cayde for answers, but the Exo just threw up his hands in defense.\n\n\"Don't look at me. Prince Whiny Face and Fikrul were thick as thieves when we found them. All I could do not to shoot either of them.\"\n\nPetra nodded toward the now royal cell, and Variks, with only a hint of hesitation, sealed the hatch, locking Prince Uldren in.\n\n\"Now, Variks,\" Cayde said, smooth as ever, \"you let me know if Fikrul here ever comes up to the arena. He and I have a conversation to finish.\"\n\n\"Of course. Of course.\" Variks noticed Petra's gaze lingered a little too long on the prince's cell. He could see she was troubled, even ashamed. Petra saw him watching and composed herself, back straight, all Wrath. She met his eyes. He could see her trouble, her shame.\n\n\"Variks. My friend.\" Was that tenderness Variks heard in Petra's voice? \"He is changed. His eyes…\" She stopped herself. Reset. \"If he speaks, don't listen. He speaks lies. Terrible lies.\" And with that, she walked away, Cayde close behind. The doors to the cellblock slammed shut behind them.\n\nVariks stood there for a long, long time. For the first time in his life, he didn't know what the next step should be.\n\nPetra Venj and Uldren Sov had long admired one another; there was an easiness about them when they were together, and a deep if unspoken affection. When the two of them joined forces in the field of battle, they were quick, effective, and dangerous. Theirs was a dance of death, and woe to the foe who met them in open combat.\n\nVariks wondered for what crimes Petra would have Uldren judged. As he reopened the prince's cell, he wondered if Petra would have Variks himself judged.\n\nVariks knelt before Uldren. \"We thought you dead. But you are in my care now, yes?\" His arms carefully brushed at the Awoken man, probing but gentle.\n\nUldren blinked and looked toward him—or rather, his golden eyes looked beyond him. Variks looked over his shoulder, just to check. Of course, no one was there.\n\n\"Sister…\" Uldren croaked through dried, cracked lips. \"What's to become of us now?\"",

He tried to move quickly, but one of his toes caught awkwardly on the grated catwalk, and he stumbled to the floor. He lifted his head to see the extraction Servitors lying shattered and lifeless, hissing as Ether evaporate wafted into the air.\n\nVariks rose, moving cautiously, slowly, uncertain who or what might be loose. He checked every seal of Fikrul's cell, then gathered enough courage to peer into the porthole.\n\nFikrul was unaffected. If anything, he looked stronger than he did before. He stood there, glaring, a devilish grin plastered across his face. \"Does it find my Ether… bitter?\" he growled.\n\nIndeed, Variks could see that something was wrong with this Ether. It was darker, tainted with something he could not identify. He tightened the seals of his mask as he examined the Servitors' remains, fearing whatever they pulled from Fikrul could be toxic. He moved through the fog-like gas as if it was water. It didn't dissipate like traditional Ether;  it lingered, heavy and opaque.\n\nVariks stepped back up to Fikrul's cell. Activated the transmission mic.\n\n\"Fikrul, asaalii akisoriks,\" he seethed, using the High Speak of Judgment, hoping that Fikrul might still respect the oldest law.\n\n\"Ah, Variks. You cling to Judgment like Rain clung to lies.\" Fikrul spat his words the way the Houseless would.\n\n\"You are Houseless. You are filth. Is this what you've done with Kaliks, served the last Prime to the Taken? Is that the blood you now breathe?\"\n\n\"Ha! You still believe I have Kaliks. Fool. Kaliks abandoned us. But my Ether… It's true Fikrul is no longer enslaved to the machines' Ether. By the grace of the Awoken Father, I have evolved.\"\n\nVariks looked back to the prince's cell, still open. The Awoken Father…\n\nVariks ambled back to the prince. With each step, he heard more clearly. He saw Uldren sitting up now, nodding, listening, peering into the shadows at something unseen. If ever there was a picture of malevolent insanity, this was it.\n\nThe prince spoke.\n\n\"Yes, Sister. I see it now. The army of the reviled that you promised me…\"",

        "description": "Variks, ever the Loyal, did as Petra commanded: Access to the lowest cellblock was reserved strictly to the Warden and the Regent-Commander. Unfortunately, this meant that every menial operational task was left to him. Meal distribution. Waste disposal. Between the eight Barons and the Awoken prince, his new chores left him little time for Judgment.\n\nThrice per day, he visited the block. And thrice per day, he had to manufacture excuses to the local Corsair detachment for why the lowest level of the prison was now off limits. Rumors swirled. It was not unknown that Petra and Cayde-6 had smuggled some unknown high-value prisoner—a humanoid prisoner no less, a first for the Prison of Elders if the rumors were true. But Variks assured anyone with the gumption to ask that his Judgment of the Scorned Barons was a sensitive process to be conducted in private.\n\nPetra herself did not help extinguish the scuttle. She was less than adept at the art of secrecy, and everyone knew it. She responded to any bold queries with a stern, \"It is none of your concern,\" which itself was tantamount to a validation that some version of the rumors was true. If only she'd found joy in her Techeun training; if only she'd learned more from the Queen.\n\nEach time Variks performed his rounds, he asked himself what loyalty—if any—he owed to the prince. And each time, he stopped short when he bore witness to the prince's… ramblings. Today was no different. There Uldren sat, elbows atop knees, staring into the same dark corner of the cell, face concealed by his long, black hair, seemingly communing with nothing.\n\n\"I see now… Yes, that's good, so good.\"\n\nMore listening; more nodding.\n\n\"Then that's what we shall do. And look, Sister, he is already here.\"\n\nUldren fell into silence, visibly relaxing. After a moment, he looked back over his shoulder and through the porthole to meet Variks's eyes.\n\n\"Your Grace,\" Variks burbled.\n\n\"Variks the Loyal.\" Uldren smirked. \"Variks the Spark. Did you have something to say to me, or are you content to play the spying crow?\" And there it was again—that fleeting pass of inky darkness that momentarily snuffs the glow of Uldren's eyes. So Variks said nothing. Whether frozen in terror or simply at a loss for words, he could not say.\n\nUldren leaned in, placed a finger against his lips, and spoke low: \"I have a secret for you, Variks. I know you want to hear it.\"\n\nVariks answered with a single, drawn out, and ever-so-slight nod.\n\n\"Your Kell lives,\" Uldren whispered. He leaned in a little closer and asked the one question Variks had never been able to answer: \"Do you know where your TRUE loyalty lies, Variks?\"\n\nUldren didn't wait for a response. His eyes almost immediately darted over his shoulder, toward the shadowy corner that has become his obsession.\n\n\"Of course we can trust him, dear Sister. He is the most loyal…\"",

        "description": "Variks admired his masterpiece, the improvised Servitor chain that would finally reveal the secrets of his fanatical former friend.\n\nUnfortunately, Fikrul refused talk of the past, would speak only of the future. Or of Uldren, his Awoken \"father,\" who snatched him from the edge of death and awakened within him a power never before seen in the Eliksni. A power over death itself. A power to remake their people and thrive in a universe of Light and Dark that had both forsaken them and left them scorned.\n\nVariks knew these feelings all too well. It was here, in the deepest catacombs of the Prison of the Elders, where he thrived, where he worked to rebuild the Eliksni. This was his home now, this workspace where he was free to explore the \"potential\" of the prison's inmates for future leverage. The emerald marrow worm-food of the Hive, the prismatic viruses of the Vex, Psion Flayer wavelengths—each of these secrets had been wrested free within these dank halls, traded among his networks for more secrets, or harnessed into weapons for the Awoken.\n\nBut the secrets of Fikrul's… mutation… eluded him. The power within was obvious. Scattered about the floor was the evidence of its potency—as well as too many nights of failure: wrecked sentry Servitors, dozens of deflated Dregs, all pulled from the upper cellblocks to act as his \"assistants.\" Whatever this cold unnatural cocktail was that coursed through Fikrul, it could not be transferred or ingested like the Ether his people needed to sustain their wretched lives.\n\nVariks was all too ready to give up, send Fikrul into the arena to face Cayde-6, and put an end to the legacy of the Scorned Barons—until one day, during Variks's rounds, Uldren spoke to him unprompted. There was a lucidity in the discarded prince's eyes, a clarity that didn't exist even before he disappeared over Saturn's rings. Uldren gave Variks a… fresh perspective.\n\nAnd so, the chain. It was a dangerous gamble, mingling Fikrul's polluted lifeblood with traditional Ether. These Servitors held seventy percent of Variks's own Ether reserves. If this failed… well, it wouldn't be the first time Variks had risked everything and lost.\n\nVariks pulled the lever.\n\nThe hum of the Servitor chain crescendoed, but all he heard was the lingering echo of Uldren's poisonous question: Do you know where your true loyalty lies, Variks?\n\nBut if it worked—perhaps Fikrul could be cured. Perhaps—if what Variks suspected was true, and Fikrul's corruption was related to the Prince's affliction—Uldren could be cured, too.\n\nVariks had said as much to Petra, but she'd refused to listen.\n\n\"You will not experiment on the Prince.\"\n\n\"Our Prince is ill. To keep him here… hide him from Awoken eyes… not right. Not right.\"\n\n\"I've made my decision, Variks.\"\n\nVariks's fingers flexed. \"Petra, the Loyal,\" he sneered. \"Perhaps the murmurs of Kamala Rior are true, yes?\"\n\nPetra glowered. \"I will handle Uldren. You will not touch him.\"\n\nShe'd turned sharply on her heel and strode out. Variks hadn't seen her since.\n\nHe devoted all his time to the Servitor chain—and to his private thoughts.",

        "description": "Variks's experiment succeeded, but not how he expected.\n\nIngestion of the Etheric concoction still resulted in Fallen death; it was not, by any means, a life-sustaining substance. It was, however, a life-GIVING substance. Though the dark Ether lingered like a heavy fog, it also seemed to reach out toward empty vessels. In this case, it found the dead Dregs that littered his floor. It slipped inside the corpses like a slow inhalation, inflating them, stretching them to the point of boils and bursting, pulling them to their feet. The dark Ether gave these lifeless Dregs… new life.\n\nThey seethed. Their breathing was steady, but hard and fast. They rumbled as if volcanoes lived inside their chests. A black fire rose from their skin as they burned this dark Ether like a jet engine burns its fuel. What Variks really saw before him was hate-fueled rage incarnate and the beginning of another Whirlwind. They were no longer just Fallen. Fikrul called them his Scorn.\n\nBehind him, Fikrul laughed and laughed and laughed until—he abruptly stopped. At that exact moment, the Scorn dropped to the floor, dead once more.\n\n\"Your scribes, your Kells, your Houses—they will all soon be forgotten, like the Elders and the Skaith before them,\" Fikrul growled in Variks's precious High Speak of Judgment. This drew Variks closer, face to face through the cell's porthole.\n\nFikrul turned his ear upward, listening. Brought his attention back to Variks. \"Father says…\" The pause hung heavy in the air. \"Father says… You know where your true loyalty lies.\"\n\nThe Fanatic stepped back from the porthole and waited.\n\nLoyalty. True loyalty.\n\nHe expected a memory of Mara to appear in his mind. But instead—\n\nInstead he found himself thinking about the prophecies of House Rain.\n\nKell of Kells.\n\nDays later, Variks performed his duties for the last time. He visited central control. Ran a test sim on the security systems, made some adjustments based on the results. Revised and signed off on the daily roster rotations. Finally, he had a private conversation with the prison's sole remaining High Servitor: The Prison of Elders would not go without a warden.\n\nHe did not speak to Petra.\n\nBy the end of that day, the Prison of Elders descended into chaos.\n\n\"Your time WILL come, Variks.\"\n\nUldren sits in his favorite spot, gazing in his favorite direction. \"She told me so. She has but one last wish of you.\"\n\n\"No, your grace.\" Variks' voice was gravelly with emotion. \"It is I who has one last service for you.\"\n\nVariks left before he could change his mind.\n\nA klaxon blared. The voice of the prison's High Servitor echoed over the loudspeakers—in Variks's voice. \"Security systems malfunction. Emergency shutdown and reboot commencing.\"\n\nThe place dropped momentarily into darkness, but emergency lighting quickly illuminated the cellblock. All around him, alarms sounded, warning lights flashed, pneumatics hissed, and cryogenic fluids evaporated to fog as the cryo-cells lining this cellblock began to open.\n\nVariks moved as quickly as he could toward the exit, not bothering to look back, for he knew what he'd see.\n\nThe Scorned Barons and Prince Uldren were free.\n\nAs was every single resident of the Prison of Elders.\n\nVariks slipped out, under cover of prison anarchy, through the same secret passage in which Petra and Cayde had smuggled Prince Uldren. There, a ship waited, loaded with the Prison's Ether stores.\n\nAs he walked, he made two recordings to be sent out by the Prison's relays once he was away. For the first, he disabled his voice synth and began, in the deep resonance of High Speak, to give commands.\n\nHe didn't know how many would answer Judgment's call. But he had to try.\n\nFor the second, he turned his voice synth back on. \"They call me betrayer. I who was most loyal. They do not think I hear the words. Bug. Insect.\" He paused. \"Fallen.\"\n\nUp, long strides, fast now, along the ramp into the ship. Toward the bridge. A vandal in Wolf colors saluted him as he passed.\n\n\"I hear the words. House of Judgement always hears. No choice. To keep the Houses together.\" He paused again, as he reached the bridge of his ship. \"Judgment always hears.\"\n\n\"The Great Machine stood in Judgment. Eliksni fell to fighting. Fell to hate.\" Emotion caught in his voice. \"Cannot stomach this hate.\" As he spoke, the ship's engines rumbled to life. On the screens, Variks could see explosions resonating through the Prison. His former charges running rampant. His ship passed through the bay's barrier and began to move off.\n\n\"Nowhere else to go. No one else to be, here.\" He drew himself up to his full height. \"And so I become Variks, the Kell. House Judgment envoy to the Eliksni people.\"\n\n\"No choice.\" He repeated, chuckling deep in his throat. His voice was calm. \"Eliksni must rise… yes?\"",

All I'll say about it is—\n\nOnly one thing scares me more than dying, and that's dying inside these walls.\n\nBut I made a promise to my home.\n\nI took the three new Guardians for a tour of the tallwalk today. Two of them are blue. Actually, truly blue. I can't stop staring. Their names are Therin Vai and Nadiya. The third is an Exo, Lee-4.\n\nTherin noticed my staring and laughed at me.\n\n\"Never seen anyone this good-looking before, have you?\"\n\n\"Never seen anyone blue,\" I said.\n\nTherin tried to explain about Awoken. He didn't know much. He doesn't remember anything since becoming a Guardian.\n\n\"Then how do Guardians pick their names?\" I asked.\n\nAccording to Therin, Exo Guardians usually remember their names, but that's it. Awoken and Human Guardians remember nothing, so they just pick new names.\n\nSo I asked them why they chose theirs. Therin puffed out his chest—his armor looked like it had once been really fancy, but it was scuffed and dirty from the road—and said, \"Because it sounds awesome! Remember the name Therin Vai—it's the name of the Guardian who will find the lost Warmind Rasputin!\"\n\nWhen he said that, Lee-4 managed to look exhausted, which is impressive for an Exo.\n\nTherin talked about Rasputin and the Baikonur for a while, so to sidetrack him I asked Nadiya where her name came from. But she just rolled her eyes. \"I don't think Micah's paying me to chitchat.\"\n\n\"You're getting paid?\" Therin said.\n\nLee-4 elbowed him hard.\n\n\"Ow! What was that for?\"\n\n\"To remind you why we're here,\" said Lee-4. It was practically the first thing I'd heard her say.\n\n\"Why are you here?\" I asked.\n\nShe fixed her electric eyes on me. \"Old debts.\"\n\n\"To Micah?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nNadiya slouched against the tallwalk parapet, her head flung back to hang over the side. I thought about pushing her over. \"Good luck with that, whatever that means,\" said Nadiya. \"I'm all about new debts. Preferably other people's debts to me.\"\n\nJust then Lee-4 swung the sniper rifle off her shoulder so fast it almost cracked Nadiya in the head. Lee-4 fitted the scope to her eye and held the weapon perfectly still, without even leaning the barrel against the wall. A pause filled only by Nadiya's complaints—and then Lee fired off a shot.\n\nOn the horizon I saw a shadow fall.\n\n\"Fallen?\" said Therin.\n\n\"Kings,\" Lee confirmed.",

Figured I'd always been that way, in my previous life and all. Joining fireteams, raiding, the Commander's Nightfalls—never my bag. Always walked alone. Never needed nobody. Except for Ghost. Ghost was my only friend. Got no shame in admitting that, not anymore.\n\nNot long after the Taken War, we'd made our way to the EDZ, looking for a place to call our own. Looking for some quiet. Maybe something resembling peace. Ghost and me, we'd been fighting since the Faction Wars. Always fighting. Non-stop fighting. And I was done. We were done. We'd been running solo ops so long, I don't think anyone even noticed we were gone. And we were glad for it.\n\nOur sudden disconnect from the Light changed all that. Like it or not, I was Guardian, he was a Ghost. Peace was never in the cards; the Traveler saw to that. Ghost reconnected to the City networks for the first time in I don't know how long only to find that comms were jammed planet-wide. So we moved west—to our original LZ, to head back to the City, to find the next fight. That's when they found us. The Cabal—Red Legion, we would later learn.\n\nThey marched us north of the Winding Cove. Set up camp within sight of the Shard. They ingested their libations. Got rowdy. They knew we were Lightless; they wanted to see what I was really made of, when I was just meat and air. I said, do your worst. And they did. Beat me within an inch of my final life and then guffawed when Ghost couldn't do anything to get me back on my feet. They ingested more of their bevvies, and one of 'em decided I had one eye too many, and he took it and popped it and laughed some more and asked me what I was gonna do about it. I laughed back, louder and crazier than they liked, and told them I had another. Then one of them, the worst one of them, took hold of Ghost, and said, I'm your Ghost now—I'm the one who decides if you live or die. Ghost was just a pebble in its meat hooks. And with no effort at all, Ghost was in pieces. Before the sun rose, they threw me off a cliff. They should have put a bullet in me. They should have fed me to their War Beasts.\n\nFigure Ghost chose me because I was some kind of hero in my before time. Maybe.

Within minutes, it was only her.\n\nShe corralled the survivors into a cave that once upon a time wasn't a cave but more of an industrial drainage system. It was foul here; the radiation was practically palpable, and the survivors—if they survived this day—would likely find their lives shortened by years if not decades thanks to this poisoned solace.\n\nShe pushed them forward, deeper into the underground, as fast as they could manage. She carried two children, both eerily silent and unaffected. They, like their people, had endured more than she could imagine in their five-thousand kilometer exodus. They had given up their homes for the promise of something better. For the promise of hope and light and the strength of the pack. In their quest for better lives, they had lost almost everything.\n\nHer Ghost told her the bad news—this cave system was a labyrinth extending dozens of kilometers with more dead-ends than not.

And by the Traveler's Light, it would be an eternity's worth.\n\nAnd so, reluctantly, her Ghost floated ahead to rejoin the exodus, but not before swearing it would come back to find her and bring her back, no matter how long it took.\n\nWith the light of her Ghost now out of sight and the soft wet steps of a hundred refugees out of ear-shot, she strapped on her helmet, tightened her gauntlets, and drew a line in the muck beneath her feet. When the chittering of Fallen Dregs finally began to echo through the tunnels, she reached for the Light and with it crafted a shield of Void energy.\n\nIf need be, she would hold this line until the end of time.",

I need the rules of engagement.\" Shaxx stared at them, and they stared back. \"Someone talk to me.\"\n\nThey both spoke at once, and Shaxx listened in silence as they talked over each other to explain the game: Teams of two launch orb projectiles at each other, and players struck are eliminated. If both players on a team are eliminated, the team is out of the tournament, and their chance to play on the field is over.\n\n\"What do you call this drill? Skirmish?

Children who must stay within designated safe zones.\" The two Guardians watched as a boy climbed the largest rock on the field, about four feet in the air, and howled at the sky. \"Of course they're gonna go a little stir-crazy. Parents bring them out to this—you'd think it would have a name—this field every month, and they have at it. Better they hit each other than climb the walls.\"\n\nShaxx stared at them.",

        "description": "A CRUCIBLE STORY\nPART THREE OF THREE\n\nThe morning turned to noon as the sky darkened with dodgeballs and filled with the battle cries of children.\n\nWhen it was over, Lonwabo had tears in his eyes, but he tried his best to stand straight. Runa had a bloody knee and stared wordlessly at the winning team: the two snarling girls from earlier in the morning. The girls lifted an unrefined mass of plasteel, a makeshift trophy, over their heads, and they roared.\n\nShaxx stared up at the Traveler. It sat, buoyed by a mantle of clouds against a blue sky. It didn't seem to notice him.\n\n\"Tell me what you've learned,\" Shaxx said to Runa and Lonwabo, his faceplate fixed skyward.\n\nThey did, and spoke for a continuous three minutes. Shaxx nodded, slowly.\n\n\"So you're not mad?\" asked Lonwabo. His face brightened.\n\n\"You've gained more from this than the victors,\" Shaxx replied. The three of them looked on as the two girls smashed the plasteel cluster into the dirt, and to the horror of all the other children, it shattered. Runa's eyes narrowed ever so slightly, a dodgeball gripped in her hands. Shaxx continued: \"Victory is key to survival. You need it. Need to fight for it. But it teaches nothing.\"\n\n\"Does that mean, in a way, we won?\" asked Lonwabo.\n\n\"No,\" Shaxx looked down at him. \"No, you were annihilated.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Lonwabo.\n\nRuna continued to stare at the shattered trophy, and the winning team. She slowly turned the dodgeball in her hand.\n\n\"Let this loss drive you,\" Shaxx said to both of them. \"But the game is over. Your focus should be on what's to come.\"\n\nLonwabo stared down at his hands. \"I think… I think I'm going to read a book,\" he said, surprising himself as he uttered the words.\n\n\"We all make our own choices,\" said Shaxx.\n\nRuna said nothing as Cayde strode up out of a shadow in the afternoon sun. \"Everything good?\" the Hunter asked Shaxx.\n\n\"Do I look like I care?\"\n\n\"Come on, buddy. The bet's fulfilled. You don't have to pout. Just remember not to challenge a Hunter with Golden Guns.\"\n\n\"I can and I will. Rematch. End of day.\"\n\n\"You're on. I hope you're ready to babysit 'til the next Dawning—\"\n\nRuna's ball struck Cayde in the neck: a stealth attack taught to her earlier in the morning. He yelped, more surprised than hurt.\n\n\"Who did that? Who did that, and how?\" the Hunter demanded loudly, as the ball bounced away. The ball didn't respond. Runa, Lonwabo, and several other children smiled.\n\n\"Shaxx. What have you been telling them?\"\n\nShaxx stared silently down at the Exo Hunter until Cayde blinked. \"I, uh, found my Sparrow,\" Cayde said, to deflect. \"I can give us a lift back to the Tower.\"\n\nAs the other children and their elders dispersed, Runa watched Cayde's Sparrow as it carried the two Guardians off towards the gleaming Tower in the distance.\n\nShe gave a Titan's salute as they disappeared from view.",

Zavala's color suggestion, though…\"\n\nHer companion held up the cloth, a ghastly combination of fluorescent yellow and blood-red that would have hurt the eyes even if it wasn't laid against a particularly nauseating set of stripes. Tess sighed. \"He can make the Hive quake in fear, but that man shouldn't be let within 10 meters of a designer's table.\"\n\nThe two women were still laughing when a shudder rocked the Tower. They turned as one in the direction of the far-off sound that followed—a roaring noise neither of them had heard before.\n\nThe PA blared in the small utility room they'd claimed as a lounge. \"Evacuation order 77 is in effect. This is not a drill. All civilians report to designated evacuation areas immediately.\"\n\nTess was at the door, palming it open when another explosion—much closer—shook them where they stood. Smoke and screams floated down the hallway.\n\nEva's memories of what followed were disjointed. She was running with Tess, gasping for breath. She remembered murmuring the names of her cousins, worrying about them down in the City. She was in a large crowd now, Tess was falling behind as Eva was crushed forward.\n\nAnother explosion, and a fire door slammed shut. Tess was gone, and Eva found herself with about 30 people in a small cargo bay between Tower North and the Hall of Guardians. A man was trying the far door, shouting that it was sealed.\n\nThen the roof came down as a large sphere crashed to the decks. Cabal clambered from the pod, struggling against their bulky armor as they began to fire at the civilians.\n\nThat's when a dazzling blast of energy took them from behind. The shouting was enough for ten men, but when Eva could see again, only one massive Guardian was there, ending a Cabal soldier with a blade as long as she was tall.\n\nThe helmeted face of Lord Shaxx turned this way and that, taking in the room. Two quick strides brought him to her side, and with a surprising gentleness, he helped Eva to her feet.\n\n\"Madam.\" He intoned, and she could feel the bass of his voice in her chest. \"I need your help.\"\n\nAt his insistence, she took charge of the civilians as he took point for their little group. With the confidence and looming presence of the Crucible master at her back, it was effortless to keep the others quiet and focused. When they reached an evac site, a trio of anxious-looking Hawk pilots waited with their craft.\n\nAs the last of the group climbed aboard, Shaxx laid a heavy hand on her shoulder. He towered over her as he said, simply, \"Comrade.\" And then he was gone, back toward the fighting, his massive sword slung over his shoulder. Eva's last view of the Tower as her Hawk pulled away was ruin and flame.",

        "description": "\"Valentina! And her son, Luis! Peregrine district! Apartment Block 10, fourth floor! It's the one…\" An explosion nearby cut her off, but she shouted into the comms unit all the louder. \"It's the one with the green awning! Please!\"\n\nThe voice of the militiawoman on the other end of the line was emotional. \"I'll send a unit! But ma'am, the fighting all across the district is—\"\n\n\"Did I not give you my Tower clearance code?\" Eva's own voice scared her. A whip-crack of anger.\n\nA pause on the other end. \"Yes ma'am. I'll go myself! Tozzi out.\"\n\nEva slumped back against the wall of the—she raised her head to look around—must have been a bakery at one point. Now the little café tables were barricading the doors and the counter's glass case had been smashed into a far wall with the display racks.\n\nThe militia Exo she'd borrowed the comms unit from snapped off another few shots over the half-wall that remained on the shop's exterior. They looked back in her direction, anxious. \"Can you fire a weapon?\"\n\nHer helpless look must have been an answer, because they reached out for the comms unit. She slid it across the floor, and they quickly punched in a sequence of codes. Another blast nearby caused the other civilians in the room to whimper and moan with fear.\n\nThe Exo barked into the unit. \"We need Guardian support, corner of the 1400 block Anchor District! I have a large number of civilians here, and our position is being overwhelmed!\" They punctuated their transmission by leaning out and firing off another half dozen shots. The Cabal roared back in animal fury.\n\nIt wasn't more than two minutes before Eva heard it: the distinctive sound of a Sparrow, running full-out. She dared to gather herself into a half crouch and peer out of the building. She was watching just in time to see a pair of them, a Hunter and a Warlock, descend on the invaders like vengeful angels. These two were professionals, she could tell—no swagger to them. They were efficient and deadly, and the soldiers began to fall back.\n\nSomething happened. Eva couldn't see what it was, but both of the Guardians reeled. The Warlock dropped to one knee, like his strings had been cut. The Hunter shook her head and raised a hand in the air, a distinctive signal, calling for the Light… but nothing happened.\n\nThe Cabal, like they'd been waiting for this moment, struck hard. The Hunter was bowled over by a charging Centurion and crushed underfoot. The Warlock didn't seem to ever really recover, and he fell to the ground, riddled by the weapon fire of a dozen soldiers.\n\nThe Exo was standing fully upright now, shocked, and even as Eva opened her mouth to tell them to get down, they fell—a sniper's target.\n\nOne of the men retched in the corner, horrified. Eva gave herself no time to think. She snatched the comm unit from the ground and pushed past the civilians to a far window. She used the reinforced case to smash out the glass and began hoisting children through once the largest shards were cleared of the frame. She was the last out of the building, and a few stray bullets plucked at the wall near her as she made her escape.\n\nThey didn't stop running until they were sure no one was following. She had no idea which district they were in, no clue even what the building used to be. Much of the orderly streets and well-tended boulevards she knew had become a maze of debris—the last safe City, a maze of collapsed and ruined structures.\n\nThe children were huddled up in a great pile as the older folk talked quietly among themselves. Everyone was crying, on and off, but they tried desperately to keep it quiet. \n\nA high-pitched chirp across the comm unit startled Eva, and she slammed her head back against the wall behind her. She hadn't even realized she still had it. She reached down and keyed the pad.\n\nA hushed voice said \"Ma'am?\"\n\nHer own voice low and shockingly gruff, she answered, \"This is Eva Levante. Is this Tozzi?\"\n\nA pause. \"Tozzi's dead. She wanted me to make sure someone got back to you, though.\" Another long pause. Eva fought the urge to scream. \"I'm sorry, Mrs. Levante. Block 10 is just gone. I think some of the automated defenses managed to come online early in the fighting and one of their command ships must have crashed…\"\n\nEva didn't hear the rest of the words.",

        "description": "Eva checked the time on the small comms unit she clutched to her chest. It seemed impossible, but it had been under two hours since she'd been sitting and laughing with Tess. Time had stretched for her, like the taffy candies some of the vendors sold during the Dawning festival. She would have sworn it was days ago. Longer than that, when she'd been sitting in her cousin's flat, hugging Valentina. Saying goodbye to Luis…\n\n\"Eva, we don't owe them anything.\" A gruff cough, one of the other civilians. Everyone's voice was a grinding imitation of itself; ash filled the air, and no one could clear their throat.\n\nEva clasped a rag to her mouth as she answered, croaking. \"How dare you?\" Her voice rose with her anger. \"Your whole life they've kept you safe, and now you want to just abandon them?\"\n\nThe subject of their dispute lay collapsed on the floor of the warehouse. A quartet of Guardians, all of them wounded and bleeding from within their flamboyant armor. Even as she weighed the future of their little band, she couldn't help but appreciate their fashion sense. The Hunter, of course, had put in the most effort.\n\nThe man arguing with her was paunchy and fashion-illiterate, wearing a bland functionary uniform: part of the Consensus staff. He scowled at her and grated out, \"We can barely move the lot of us around, let alone all of us and a bunch of wounded, powerless Guardians. Why should we risk our—\"\n\n\"You don't think they've risked their lives a hundred times over for you?\" She pulled the rag away from her face and coughed a mass of phlegm and ash to the side. Her mother would have died all over again of shock. \"We have to keep moving, we have to keep them with us, and we have to hold out. Whatever this is, it's temporary.\"\n\nHe grimaced, but she pressed on. \"When they regain the Light they'll…\"\n\nHer diatribe was cut short by a blast of static on the comm unit, so loud she dropped it on the floor. The reinforced case took the blow, and so everyone around clearly heard the deep voice of Commander Zavala when he began to speak. \"Citizens of the Last City. Hear my words.\"\n\nLike a people dying of thirst, the civilians moved in to circle the comm unit. Zavala had been a pillar, a beacon of hope all their lives. Surely he would…\n\n\"We are abandoning the City. We have evacuated everyone we could, but the Cabal now hunt Guardians in the streets. If you are able, you should make for the wilds.\" Eva felt as if she'd been physically struck.\n\n\"The Cabal have affixed a device to the Traveler and severed our connection to the Light. We cannot hold the City, and we cannot protect you.\" There was a long pause, as if he was weighing his words carefully. When he spoke again, Zavala sounded very, very tired.\n\n\"We are setting a rally point elsewhere in the system—watch for a broadcast. We will return to the City someday, but… I do not know when.\" Another pause. \"Be safe. Be brave.\" And he was gone.\n\nTo their credit, the group did not yell or shout. Even though it had only been a matter of hours, they were all alive because they'd learned not to give away their position. They did cry, though. Tears streaked trails down faces covered in ash; those faces looked from one to another as they sought to understand, to comprehend.\n\nEva did not cry. As she stared at the comms unit, all she could think about were Zavala's shoulders. She'd often joked with him about the size of the pauldrons on his armor, that massive protective plate on his left shoulder. And now… for some reason, she thought she understood. The weight on his shoulders…\n\nEva stood, and all eyes turned to her. She flinched a little. Then, choosing her words carefully: \"Most of them are leaving. So we have to help them.\" She gestured at the Guardians. \"If we can keep them alive, they can protect us, keep us safe.\" She looked around the group, found people nodding.\n\n\"Where do we go?\" one woman asked.\n\nEva looked back down at the comms unit. \"The Cabal will have heard that. They'll be watching the walls, expecting us to try to leave.\" She looked up, out at the room. \"So we stay here. We make for the edge of the City and try to find somewhere the Cabal won't expect us to be.\"\n\nThe seamstress reached down and pulled up the comms unit, slinging it over her shoulder. \"Everybody up. It's a long way to Twilight Gap.\"",

        "description": "Just getting to the outskirts of the City was an ordeal. Every day, they saw the Cabal's control tightening. Civilian groups or the odd Guardian tried make a break for it only to be brought down by a swarm of ships hungry for a kill. The streets were no safer, with patrols moving in tandem and tanks rumbling through district centers.\n\nYears of supporting the Guardians, of listening to their idle chatter, had filled Eva's head with details about these horrific invaders. She realized they were doing rigid block-by-block sweeps, unimaginative and plodding. Just as described at the Tower.\n\nTheir group hid and observed and moved only when the Cabal did. In that careful manner, they arrived at the far reaches of the City—parts long abandoned, where Humanity was just a shadow cast upon the walls.\n\nEva found herself in consultation every day, organizing foraging patrols back toward the center. Evenings were spent suggesting strategies for the upcoming days.\n\nAnd to her great satisfaction, she spent nights sitting with a needle and thread, trying to make sure the survivors would stay warm on the move.\n\nAs the three Guardians recovered (they lost the Titan on the way to the Gap), they started offering more guidance. At their suggestion, the survivors never stayed in the same place more than a day or two. They posted lookouts every night and turned on the comms unit only every other day to listen for broadcasts. For chance transmissions. For hope.\n\nEva was there in the room when the Guardians heard Zavala's voice—his short, terse statement played over and over. \"If there is any Light left in the system… we rally on Titan.\"\n\nShe shut the door so the other civilians wouldn't hear and listened as they had it out. The other Warlock, Tam, identified herself as Trinh's sister. They were adamant that they try—somehow—to get offworld and head for Titan. The Hunter, Ramos, was just as adamant they stay.\n\nTheir discussion wound down and came to a slow stop with all three Guardians looking at her. She held up her hands and said, \"I trust you all to do the right thing.\" They stayed. And quickly became integral to the success of their… operation.\n\nWhat had begun as simple survival became an organized effort to evacuate civilians from the Last City. Foraging parties inevitably came back with more people than they left. Scouting parties probed the edges of the City and found avenues of escape, places where the Cabal were lax in their patrols.\n\nEva found that the same skills she'd used to plan holidays at the Tower were invaluable in organizing this underground movement. She cobbled together boards from old classrooms to create a schedule and wrote on the backs of old forms and newsletters to make \"delivery packages\" of civilians and the occasional Lightless Guardian.\n\nDay in, day out, this became her quiet routine. She faded into the background of the Underground: plan, move, sew, repeat. Even when contact was finally made with the Farm and getting survivors to the EDZ became the goal, Eva was always there making sure the trains ran on time.\n\nAfter some thought, she asked that her role not be spread around. She got word to people like Tess that she was alive, and that was enough for her. She had the chance to get out of the City dozens of times.\n\nBut every time she thought she'd take that exit, go with that convoy, she stopped herself. Settled back. Did the work.\n\nThat was how the months of the Red War passed for Eva Levante.",

        "description": "\"Abuela? Ma'am?\"\n\nIt was quiet, almost a whisper, but enough to wake Eva. For a spinning, disorienting moment, she thought she was sitting in her living room back in Peregrine district. Her favorite afghan over the end of the couch and Carlos standing over her… but that wasn't Carlos.\n\nThe concerned face of the Hunter, Ramos, looked down at her. More than a few of the Guardians that went through the Underground had taken to calling her grandmother, but Ramos had stuck with the group through all the long months of the war.\n\nHe was very protective, sometimes smothering, and she sighed as she rubbed at her eyes. \"I'm up. I'm up. What time is it?\" She sat up on the old couch she'd been sleeping on, wincing as she tried to sort the knots she'd developed sleeping on her side.\n\n\"Almost 0700?\" His voice was low and a little sheepish.\n\nShe glared at him. \"You were supposed to wake me an hour ago.\"\n\nHis grin was lopsided. \"You needed the sleep.\"\n\nShe stood carefully and tottered on unsteady legs, turning her face away so he couldn't see her annoyance. \"Are they waiting?\"\n\n\"They've only just arrived. One of the reasons I waited. They're not expecting you for another 10 minutes.\" Trying to justify himself.\n\nEva sighed again. \"Thank you, Ramos. You're right; I did need the sleep. I was up again too late last night. Go tell them I'll be right down.\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am.\" He sounded happier, and his footfalls as he left the room were light, confident.\n\nEva stepped into the bathroom off the main living quarters of this second-floor flat. Her morning routine sorted, she poured some water out of one of the ration canisters into the stoppered-up sink so she could wash, try to feel a little less like she'd slept on a half-rotten couch in an abandoned building.\n\nWater dripping down her nose, she reached blindly for one of the pieces of scrap cloth they used for towels and dried her face. When her eyes cleared, she found herself looking at a stranger.\n\nEva had always been on the thin side. She could still remember her mother chiding her, telling her to eat and clean her plate. Now the woman staring back at her was positively gaunt. Bags under her eyes, hair chopped brutally short, and her clothes! The clothes she'd been wearing the day of the attack hadn't lasted two weeks, never intended for living rough. The homespun outfit she'd stitched for herself would never have passed muster back at the Tower, but… out here they had to do. At least she'd been able to salvage her trademark shawl. Something to remind her of better days…\n\nAs she drifted into the living room, Eva reflected that better days, of course, were why the group was gathered downstairs. All of the Underground cell leaders gathered in one place for an important—perhaps final—conversation.\n\nFor the Underground, the Red War was a stunning victory. They'd won. The only civilians and Guardians left in the City were those unwilling or unable to go. Eva frowned, saddened.\n\nEvery few weeks they heard stories of a group of Guardians overrun from a supposedly secure bunker by a Legion assault. The loss of civilian life had been staggering, both in the initial assault and the intervening months.\n\nAs she looked down into the street through a slit around the boarded-up window, she had to admit to a feeling of… satisfaction. Now all that was left was for the Underground itself to pull out, make for the Farm and the safety-in-numbers of Hawthorne's group. Eva raised her eyes from the empty streets to the distant sight of the Tower, twisted and ruined.\n\nShe would stay, she had decided. Guardians like Ramos could check on her from time to time, but someone needed to stay behind and keep the lights on. There could be refugees still alive out there. Still hoping for a way… out.\n\nShe turned away from the window to head downstairs when the explosion ripped through the street in front of the apartment, and Eva's world turned white.",

She'd heard a few seconds of a whining engine overhead, and then a massive explosion ripped through the street in front of the Underground apartment.\n\nThe blast had thrown her to the ground like a doll. Everything hurt, and from somewhere close by she could hear the guttural shouting of Cabal soldiers. The distinctive sound of Guardian weapon fire was answering. Someone was screaming.\n\nWithout thinking, she was on her feet, lurching toward the far corner where her shotgun lay on a side table. Three steps, four, weapon in hand and checked. Just in time as the apartment door flew open and a pair of Psions stepped through, weapons ready.\n\nEva Levante, seamstress of the Tower, would have been taken aback. The gaunt woman she'd just seen in the mirror had spent months dry firing the weapon. Endless drills had trained her for action and her first shot took the one on the right in the chest and blew him out of the room. It had not prepared her for the kickback, however, and she felt something crack in her arm as the weapon bucked against her.\n\nThat flinch saved her life as she unwittingly pivoted to the side, narrowly avoiding shots from the other Cabal creature. Roaring, she raised the weapon against and her answering blast threw him against the far wall.\n\nBreathing heavily, she reloaded the weapon with one hand and waited, listening. No more outside that she could hear. Fighting was fierce downstairs. They needed her. She stepped to the door, weapon outstretched…\n\nThe sound of the wardog bursting through the apartment window was like another explosion. Eva whirled around as the scaly beast scuttled to the side, and another pair threw themselves from the hovering troop transport into the small living space. They landed with surprising grace, and three sets of hungry eyes stared at the seamstress. Drool smeared the floor as three sets of fanged mouths worked, eagerly.\n\nEva fired.\n\nThe beasts charged.",

        "description": "Eva Levante stood leaning against the ivy-covered outer wall of the barn, gazing down into the football field at the Farm. The old nets were slack, now. Needed to be rehung. No one came by who cared enough to restring them, and the Farm's current inhabitants were not the sporty type.\n\nBeyond the field were the rolling hills of the European Dead Zone, and on the horizon the twisted, ruined spur that was the Shard of the Traveler. Her first days back on her feet, recovering from the attack at the apartment, she'd stared in wonder at that view. \n\nNow she watched the clouds idly roil and collect around the Shard, bored. Eva smiled, and shifted her weight off the wall and onto the carved cane that kept her upright. To think after everything that had happened, she could be bored.\n\nHer first days at the Farm had been a whirlwind of medical treatments, rushed through by attendants already on their way out as she was coming in. It had been the final days of the Red War, a major operation planned to retake the City.\n\nOne old woman coming in from the Underground was a low priority, and in the commotion even the old friends she'd hoped to see had missed her.\n\nNow, she was alone. Or, mostly alone. She turned her head to see the Cryptarch, Tyra Karn, chattering away with Farm's postal frame. With primary operations returned to the City, Darbi had become Tyra's unofficial research assistant. Together they continued to study and examine Humanity's history through the lens of the Dead Zone, a sideline from the turmoil at the Tower Tyra was apparently only too happy to claim.\n\nThe scout, Devrim, came by every once in a while for a chat as well. When he was feeling cheeky, he referring to their little group as the \"old hands club,\" usually smirking over the top of a cup of tea.\n\nBoth still had official jobs to do, of course, and they took their roles very seriously. \n\nEva was at the Farm very unofficially. Her role at the Tower had never been one vital to operations, of course… but no one had rushed to ask her back to the market, either. Tess and Banshee had reached out once in a while, and she'd given advice on how to set up their new space.\n\nBut Eva was here at the Farm for the lost. \n\nThey trailed into the place in ones and twos. They all shared something in common: the Shard hadn't connected with them. They came to sit and stare at it, off in the distance. To talk about how hard the Red War had been, as unpowered Guardians—some forced by circumstance to literally sit on the sidelines.\n\nWhen the Light had returned, some of them reported that it felt different. It sat under the skin like a suit that didn't quite fit anymore.\n\nA diminutive Exo woman was one of the pilgrims Eva remembered most clearly. She hadn't even known they made Exos that short. The woman shifted and twitched as she talked, unable to calm herself. \n\nAt the mention of the Light fitting differently, a statement she'd heard a lot of Guardians make, Eva asked the same question she always did. \"So does that mean the Light is different now? Or are you?\"\n\nThe Exo stopped and narrowed her eyes, thinking. She was stock still for the first time since arriving at the Farm. \n\nThat was usually how it went. Sometimes asking the question was all it took to get them sorted out. Others took a lot longer, sometimes spending weeks at a time at the Farm just doing as Eva was: staring up at the Shard.\n\nSome… some came to the Farm, found no answers, and left on foot walking toward that great landmark on the horizon. So far as Eva knew, none of them had ever come back through the Farm.\n\nIt was a strange life. Another strange time, another role she'd never asked for. But she found she was good at it.\n\nAnd Eva Levante had no interest in returning to the City.",

        "description": "The comms unit in her little room chirped loudly enough to wake Eva from a sound sleep. Eva had turned the little outbuilding into something of a homey space with use of fabrics and art scavenged from the Dead Zone, but as it often did when she woke suddenly these days, it took her a moment to remember where she was.\n\nShe groaned as she slid out of bed, using nearby furniture to steady herself. The damage the War Beasts had done had been extensive, and even now she could feel the tightness in her legs where the Bray tech had knit bone and sinew back together.\n\nShe slumped into the little chair in front of the comms unit. The light from the screen lit the room, which was otherwise almost completely dark. She blearily peered into the unit, as the image of Tess Everis resolved itself. It was daylight in the City, and Tess was impeccably dressed for work.\n\n\"Do you have any idea what time it is here?\" Eva asked, allowing the annoyance to seep into her words.\n\n\"Yes. I do.\" Something in Tess's voice made Eva sit up and look closer. There was a tightness to Tess's face. She looked… frightened.\n\n\"Tess, what's going on? Are you all right?\" Eva was wide awake now, and plucked at the edge of her teal robe to draw it around her. She was suddenly cold.\n\n\"I'm sorry, sweetheart. Just… wanted you to know right away. I bet Tyra's getting a call from Rahool right now.\" Tess looked down and away before looking up into the camera again. \"Sweetie, Cayde's dead. Something happened out at the Reef yesterday. I don't know all the details, but everyone's talking about it.\"\n\nEva's mouth formed a thin, worried line. She'd never been overly fond of the Hunter Vanguard, but so many people looked up to him. Relied on him. And if something was powerful enough to kill Cayde-6… \"The Legion?\"\n\nTess shook her head. \"Still quiet, as far as word around here goes.\" She gave a dim smile for the first time since Eva had picked up. \"You know how reliable the rumor mill is, though. It could be anything.\"\n\nEva sat back in her chair, frowning. \"I'm sorry, dear. I know you liked him.\" Tess shrugged, trying to play it off. \"Don't give me that, we weren't swapping stories in the Market that long ago.\"\n\nTess stopped, and nodded sadly. \"There's going to be a memorial service, I think. Will you come back for it?\"\n\nIt was Eva's turn to look away from the screen. It was the first time someone had asked her to go back. And for a funeral, of all things. Eva was about to make an excuse when Tess continued, her smoky voice taking on a light tinge of humor.\n\n\"While you're here you can sort out the holiday programming for the frames.\"\n\nEva's eyes widened. \"The frames are doing holidays without me?\"\n\nTess's smile broke into a full grin. \"We were just as surprised! Somehow all of the holiday gear got packed along with critical supplies in the transfer to the new Tower. And when your programs kicked in, they were able to find the tagged crates.\" Tess picked up her comms unit and angled the lens so that it would show the Dawning hat sitting on top of a mannequin in the corner of the room.\n\nEva shook her head, disbelieving. \"They did the Dawning without me.\"\n\nTess's face came back into frame. \"Over the summer, Ikora got someone to help her set up an event to commemorate the end of the War, too.\" \n\nEva tried not to let her annoyance show on her face. \"How was it?\"\n\nTess shook her head from side to side, evaluating. \"Oh… you know. OK.\" When she saw Eva's mouth tighten, Tess laughed. \"It didn't have your touch, sweetie.\" She sighed. \"Oh, it feels good to laugh. Come back to the Tower! Even if it's just to pay your respects. I haven't given you a hug in what feels like years.\"\n\nIn the darkness of her room, Eva turned to look out her window. On the horizon, the dim glow of the Shard was like an anchor, a symbol of the past.\n\nEva looked back toward her friend and smiled.",

        "description": "Eva Levante pulled opened the door to her storage unit and gagged at the smell. She turned to the two frames who were accompanying her and pointed inside.\n\n\"Start by sanitizing the whole space. When it's clean, we'll start moving in the crates.\" The frames both nodded to her and beeped affirmation. They were already sweeping with abandon as they crossed the threshold. Eva stumped back several paces, supported by her cane, to avoid getting any dirt on her outfit.\n\nAround her, the marketplace swirled with activity. Civilians on break ate at the lunch counter, shoppers browsed the stalls, frames cleaned and patrolled and delivered goods, and Guardians were everywhere—a riot of color and style as they flipped and floated and leapt around the space.\n\nEva scowled, frustrated with herself again for letting Tess and (to an extent) Amanda talk her into returning. None of this felt right, none of it felt… comfortable. And now this space they'd given her to store her wares had apparently last been opened and cleaned sometime before the Faction Wars.\n\nShe found a bench along one of the market's walkways and sank gratefully down, watching the crowd pass by. Fashion, as it always did in the City, had moved quickly since the day the Legion attacked. She was still catching up, still finding her footing. Rebreather masks in particular dotted the faces in the crowd, more stylish and ornamental than practical—a holdover from a necessity in the days rebuilding and restoring the City.\n\nAnd the Guardians! Tess had spent much of their time together since her return filling her in on fashion trends among the Lightbearer set, and Eva was incredibly impressed. Tess, the foundries, even the Vanguard had outdone themselves. Armor designs and shader schemas had improved dramatically since her days at the old Tower.\n\n\"What am I even going to do here?\" she muttered to herself. \"What can I do that…\" she trailed off, watching a Guardian walk by with what appeared to be a full crest rising above his helmet and a Warlock robe that flowed and rippled behind him in the breeze.\n\n\"That's it.\" Eva stood, heading for the door to tell the frames to stop cleaning, when someone stepped into her path. A Guardian in a leather trench coat, with a shiny black helm.\n\n\"Eva?\" The voice was distorted. She could see her own face reflected in the helmet, confused.\n\nThe gloved hands came up and the headpiece came off to reveal the smiling face of Ramos. \"Abuela! It's me!\" He pulled her into an enormous hug as she smiled.\n\n\"You rascal. You never gave me the chance to thank you.\" She swatted him kindly on the shoulder as she pulled away. \"Just save a woman's life and then ride off to retake the City, why don't you?\"\n\nRamos laughed, happier than she'd ever seen him. The Light hung around him easily, and he turned to a pair of Guardians who were standing nearby, watching tentatively. \"Team, this is Eva Levante! You remember my stories? This woman is a legend!\"\n\nHe gestured at the two. \"Eva, these two are shiny as Glimmer. Just became Guardians before the Legion attacked.\"\n\nEva nodded her head deeply to them. \"Good to meet you both.\"\n\nOne raised a hand in an awkward greeting, while the other cocked their head. \"What… do you do here?\"\n\nEva sighed. \"Oh, I'm not… I'm not actually.\"\n\nRamos laughed and said, \"She's a phenomenal seamstress! A hero of the war! And before that, she was one of the pillars of life in the Tower. Remember the Dawning holiday you liked so much? She brought that to the Tower!\"\n\nThe two turned back to her, impressed. \"How did you get Zavala to agree to… to…\"\n\nEva smiled. \"To have fun?\" She laughed at the responses she got from all three Guardians, and tapped her cane twice on the ground. \"That's a very good story. If you have some time?\"\n\nRamos laughed. \"Absolutely! Come, let's get some food. And we can help these Kinderguardians learn a thing about what it means to be part of the Tower.\"\n\nWith help from her friend, Eva Levante walked easily across the market square of the Tower, bastion of the Last Safe City.

We weren't hiding our work, per se, but it was not advertised—we'd been scolded and warned enough times that we knew to continue our efforts in private as best we could.

Was it righteous? Or pure, anger—vengeance driven by a lust for \"justice\"?\n\nI know the feeling. I know the sensation—loss, followed by a hole so big you can't fill it with anything but retribution. I've felt that hole twice. First when everything I'd known was turned to ash. I was just a child then. No way of knowing when, or if, the pain would end. A man—Jaren, my third father—helped redirect that pain. Give me purpose. Taught me to hunt. Taught me to survive. Taught me about vengeance. \n\nIt felt good—like a fire inside. Or so I thought. In truth, the \"good\" was just a dulling of the pain—a covering up of the burden of my loss through the redirection of my focus. Why be sad? Why be broken? When you can be angry. And so I was. For a long time.\n\nAfter Jaren died—killed by the would-be monster and his Weapon of Sorrow—I hated him for a good while. I was alone again. Lost. I had no direction. I felt abandoned—just me and the hole left by losing everything I knew\n\nThe man who'd destroyed my life twice over—first the burning of Palamon, my home, then the murder of my mentor and father-figure—still walked the wilds, but I was just a young man, angry and frightened. Vengeance—the fire inside me—was a weight, not a comfort, because I lacked the confidence needed to see it through. \n\nI spent a long time mad—at the murderer who played in shadows, at Jaren for leaving me, at the world, at myself for being lost, at Jaren's Ghost for not believing in me. My anger defined me. As did yours. For a short while. What I wonder is, have you ever considered…\n\nCayde's death was not the origin of your recent aggression, but simply a catalyst for its release. That it's possible this whole second life of yours has been driven by vengeance: for the life you lost before your return as a Guardian, for the world—worlds—lost to the Great Collapse. Are you truly fighting to protect and reclaim, or have you been fighting this whole time to avenge?\n\nWhat are you fighting for now? Does your anger define you?\n\nIf yes, if no—what are the consequence of either? Honestly. Truly. Ask yourself…\n\nWhat are you fighting for? And can you feel a fire—even a spark—welling up inside of you?\n\n—S.",

But I've found most who choose this life—a life in search of answers mired in shadow—rarely grasp the extent of their actions. Few reflect. Few actually understand. I've seen the damage done by those who would control the uncontrollable. I won't allow it to repeat. To the best of my ability, I will stand against the corruption and challenge all who let the whispers in.\n\nYet, here we are.

But here's another truth—\n\nI've told you very little that is new. Every word. Every question. Each time I've implored you to reflect. I was nudging you down a path you had already chosen. To consider your actions is at the core of you. I have seen it. I have heard of it—in the words of your fellow Guardians as they recount your feats—your courage, your selflessness. You may tread the razor's edge of damnation, but you are, at your very heart, a just and noble warrior.\n\nIf I played any hand in expanding your consideration of the people and worlds around you. If I've helped you take better stock of all you are and all you are capable of becoming. So be it. But it was all—all of it—already inside of you.\n\nThis isn't a pep talk. This isn't a signal boost for your hero's ego. I am saying this because I know things you do not know—from experience. \n\nRight now, I imagine you are questioning your true nature, \"Who is this 'renegade' to define me? My thoughts? My actions?\" Could be you've been warned about me. Could be, maybe, you're a little scared. After all, \"the man with the golden gun doesn't play well with others.\" I leave all that nonsense to you. But by way of a quick word in defense of my intentions…\n\nIf they were anything but in your best interest, this conversation would've been had with lead, not words. And it would've been your last.\n\nAnd while you have dark thoughts, and are no saint, we are all far from pure. It's not the lack of sin that makes the best of us, it's that the best of us feel the weight of our deeds, and do not succumb—to the weight, to temptation.\n\nAnd I know something you don't know—a secret. The hows and whys don't matter—that's an understanding for another day. But know this…\n\nWhen you are at your lowest. When hope has faded and you're all alone—in the world, inside your head. When the odds are stacked and despair has taken hold. Remember your fire. It's always there. Once sparked, once the anger—once fear—has lit the fuse, the flame will remain, always—a beacon signaling to eternity that you are here and you will stand, no matter the obstacle. And, in the end, if you so choose, it won't be whispers and shadows that save you—that corruption seeks only to abuse. No—\n\nIt will be your first loud words, and your enemies' last. \n\nDon't question the moment. This is my only, best advice. Take hold. Speak clearly. The echoes followed by silence will tell the tale, and the Last Word will be ever yours.\n\n—S.",

From childhood to now—not constant, not always, but anymore it's what defines me. My drive has long been clear—seek the shadow and your future is forfeit, seek the dark and I will end you. It's not personal—not anymore, though it surely started that way and stayed as such until one day on a lonely ridge.

Reminds me of my own childhood.\n\nLike when my mother would tell me ghost stories. They fascinated me. Especially the really creepy ones where ghosts would try to communicate with people.\n\nI decided I was going to be the first person to truly make contact with one. Headed to the creepiest part of my house, the basement. I was going to just sit in the dark and wait until something, anything showed up. But, my plan was cut short. Took one hell of a tumble down the basement stairs. Many bruises and a broken arm later, my mother reminded me that ghosts weren't real. That I should stick to what I could see in front of me.\n\nBut sometimes you just want to believe in a thing, you know? Because what if it is real? What if this big beautiful universe we barely know is much stranger and more complicated than any of us realize?\n\nShouldn't we want to look beyond what we can see with our eyes?\n\nI mean—a gigantic ominous ball floats in the sky over other planets and terraforms them.

Sure, we've benefitted from it immensely. But so many people around the world put their blind trust in it. Their faith, even. To a fault. A huge one.\n\nWe've let ourselves become hypnotized by the Traveler into thinking we're all safe. We've let ourselves become naïve about the world around us. We've let our guard down on a personal level. All in the name of achieving world peace and all—we claim—because the Traveler inspired us to do so.\n\nWe're comfortable. Complacent. Unprepared for the next time fate tells to wash us all away. And make no mistake, it will.\n\nMy daughter's not old enough yet to comprehend the Traveler.

I offered them the Obsidian Accelerator. I gave it freely.\n\nYou promised you would leave me, and you did… but you never said how far you would go, did you? You stayed close enough to watch through your scope.\n\nAs the man took aim at my head, I heard the shot and assumed I was dead. But it was him who was dead, not me. You were so far that none of us knew where to look.\n\nThe second man winged me with one of our own weapons. He began to gloat about that, but another round from you shut him up. Two more thunderous shots, and their drones were as dead as they were.\n\nI saw the glare from your scope disappear, and I knew you were heading away. I know you must feel guilty, but don't. It was I who wronged you.\n\nI grabbed the accelerator and got as far from the shouts of the aggressors as I could. They've been on my tail. By now, you're long gone and I've lead those people back inland.\n\nBut I'm done running. The end of my story is close, as it probably should be. So I guess it's time I tell you a few things about, well, you. The end of your life should have followed its natural trajectory. I'm ashamed I changed it for selfish reasons.\n\nDoes the name \"Adelaide\" bring you any flicker of recognition? It is your birth name, and you heard it every day of your life until the day I sent you without your consent into a new world.\n\nYou became Ada-1 when I robbed you of your end. I've loved you since before you were born, and in trying to give you everything, perhaps I've robbed you of a final human experience: a dignified death.\n\nI know I will not see you again. If you want to know about your past, know that you were born a second time in the Niobe Labs. When you were wounded at the labs and I saw you were losing your fight, I did what I always did when the chips were down: I… created something. You, Ada-1. From what I had almost completely lost. I did it out of fear of losing you forever. I charted the course of your life and made decisions that were yours to make, not mine.\n\nI hope you find it in your heart to forgive me for that.\n\nI was naïve. Looked too often to the past. I just couldn't let any of it go. I never did have much respect for the natural order of things. And Helga, well… she was the opposite of me. She only wanted to grow the Armory, to see its full potential. And Yuki helped make that vision possible. The two of them spent as much time looking ahead as I did looking back.\n\nI realize now that there's a balance to life. You look backward a little, you look forward a little. But most importantly, you live in the here and now. You appreciate what you have, because you never know when it'll all be snatched from you.\n\nLearn from our successes and our missteps. Be bold. Do not fear the future. Respect the past. And never forget where you came from. And try never to fear death, if you can help it. I know I don't anymore.\n\nYou know what's funny? I never considered how lucky I was for the time we had together. The envy of all the mothers who ever lived.\n\nI got to love you twice.\n\nYour Mother,\nHenriette",

Then I said, Eva, these traditions are bigger than you. They live in the hearts and minds of the people who have passed them on, generation after generation!\n\nNow I am back in the Tower, helping to create the loveliest Dawning celebration yet. And I carry on a tradition I am sure to repeat every year: I ask Ikora to make the Dawning Crystal, and I ask until she does it.\n\nI make an appointment to discuss the decorations, but I know she's always very busy with urgent Vanguard business. That is why, when I approach her alcove and hear low voices, I don't barge right in; I just peek a little bit.\n\nIkora is muttering—she sounds almost angry. \"Dawning decorations! I've got no time for frivolous…\"\n\nA male voice says, \"It is not 'frivolous.' People need this. I understand that it's hard for you because it's the first Dawning without Cay—\"\n\n\"Stop talking, Ophiuchus. Right now.\" I do not see who Ikora is talking to or recognize this name, but Ikora's voice is sharp. \"I have other concerns. What about the latest reports out of the Tangled Shore? I don't know what to make of them. And my Hidden have reported trouble brewing closer to home…\" I notice her eyes drift across the main passageway, to a secluded nook with a partially closed gate.\n\n\"Yes, Ikora. But—\"\n\n\"And there's never any word from Osiris. Not that I expect it, but…\" She shakes her head.\n\n\"With respect, why not just message him?\"\n\n\"Perhaps. I just don't have the time to…\" She pauses. \"Eva Levante!\"\n\nI make sure to tread loudly and rustle my sheaf of Dawning Crystal designs as I enter (why have her think I was eavesdropping?). Ikora watches me, her arms crossed. Her Ghost hovers by her ear, whirring with alertness.\n\n\"Happy Dawning, Ikora Rey!\" I begin. She can tell by my big bright smile and the firm way I spread out the designs for her to pick from that it will go faster if she says yes. She respects our tradition, though; she says no twice, then she says fine, Eva, fine. She does not believe the crystal matters, though; she avoids my gaze, but her Ghost—I see his eye blink at me.\n\nThe design she promises to make is exquisite.\n\nWe agree to meet again when she finishes it. I join her in the Bazaar while running errands with my assistant Malia—so many last-minute tasks! When we march up, Ikora and her Ophiuchus are huddled together. She keeps shaking her head. But still she lifts her arms, and suddenly an enormous Dawning Crystal winks into being in the skies above the Tower, like a million diamonds suspended in air.\n\nMalia gasps. She has never been so high in the Tower, nor seen the Dawning Crystal up close; only from the City far below. She drops all the packages she was carrying.\n\nThe Warlock Vanguard helps Malia pick them up, piling one parcel on top of another until she realizes Malia is still as stone, kneeling, watching her, watching her hands that had kindled light from air. The poor girl's scarred face is slick with tears, and she wipes them with her sleeve, but the tears will not stop. Malia's family escaped the City during the Red War, you see; though they survived and have a home again, there have never been many beautiful things in their lives.\n\nMalia touches Ikora's arm and mouths a thank-you. Her cheeks flush red as a pincushion.\n\nThen I kneel too (a bit slowly nowadays) to take the packages from Ikora—all but one, bound in golden ribbon and embossed with an open eye encircled by a sun. I nod and press it into her hands. Then I hear that Ghost of Ikora's whisper, \"I told you so,\" and Ikora reply, \"So you did.\"\n\n---\n\nTraveler Donut Holes:\nMix Cabal Oil and Flash of Inspiration, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.",

Nora had been on the road since she was a girl, sometimes with nothing more than an old scribbled map and that shotgun of hers. She didn't need much, but she did need people. Nora met Amanda's father in some half-abandoned village, and when she told him about the Last Safe City, well, he followed her. They had no family but themselves.

But they believed. They had hope. They pushed on.\n\nAmanda told me about one particular Dawning they had shared out in the wilds. They had fallen in with another family that had a child, Lucia, a bit older than little Amanda. They were agreeable travel companions. They found themselves in the thick of the forest, with the wind wailing, a storm coming down, branches flying… and realized they had to stay put.\n\nSo, they find the wreckage of a dropship, lean up a wing and crumpled siding, and squeeze all the grown-ups and the two little ones into the dry space under the rusted hull.\n\nThen Amanda's mother says, \"We'll be here a while. Might as well do something to keep our spirits up.\"\n\nShe sends the adults out foraging for something to eat, something to drink, and something to keep dry. Amanda's father comes back with long-leaved plants to weave into mats. Their companions return with full water flasks, some prickly fruit, and a dozen or so wild vegetables like cucumbers. With dried fish from their packs, it is quite the feast.\n\nAs the adults are working, Lucia is curling the rinds from the fruit into little flowers, but little Amanda is kicking her legs, restless. \"Make yourself useful; make some decorations,\" Amanda's mother urges her. She hands Amanda wires and nuts and bolts and a circuit board full of little lights.\n\nLucia comes jumping, an old battery in her hand. Together the girls make miniature garlands of tiny bulbs. And Lucia shows Amanda how to touch the wires to the battery to make them light up. Bright little lights in the vast dark forest.\n\nAmanda told me about the fruit, with soft white flesh and a sour taste. She told me about how they sang made-up songs together with no words, just humming and tapping out a beat on the metal walls of their shelter.\n\nShe doesn't know what the fruit was. Maybe it does not exist anymore. The other family? They got separated from Amanda's people. Later on, Amanda's parents… gone, like so many others on the road to the Last Safe City.\n\nBut Amanda Holliday still makes the lights, you know. Uses spare odds and ends to decorate her workshop. She does it every Dawning.\n\n---\n\nChocolate Ship Cookies:\nMix Cabal Oil and Null Taste, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.",

        "description": "Some residents of the Tower have been around very long indeed. The Guardians, the Exos, the old Iron Lord—they have seen Dawning after Dawning. Even before the Tower began observing the holiday as we now know it, there were those who would always celebrate with similar ceremonies of light and hope. Sometimes these memories blend together. But the feeling… the feeling remains.\n\nThis Dawning season—last week? the week before? I can't even remember, haha!—one of my suppliers tells me they had two of my boxes delivered to the Gunsmith by mistake. So, I go to see Banshee-44 to sort it all out.\n\nThe Exo has no recollection of a delivery. But he recognizes me, and I notice his eyes glow a teensy bit brighter. \"Must be about the Dawning,\" he mumbles, and he turns on his heel and heads straight to some shelves at the back. He returns with two big boxes.\n\n\"These them?\" he asks.\n\nWe open the first one up. Inside, we find a very, very old box of chocolates. Many different portable kits for cleaning weapons. A copy of \"Hunter of the Heart\" (I know this novel, but it is not for everyone). A necklace with a bullet pendant, tucked with care into a little box. Stacks and stacks of Dawning greeting cards.\n\nI shake my head gently. \"Those are presents people have given YOU for the Dawning, Banshee!\"\n\nThe Gunsmith blinks a couple of times. Then, he closes the carton—I worry he should have thrown away the chocolates, but maybe next year—and then turns to the other one on the counter. He lifts the cover.\n\nIt is full of Dawning gifts, wrapped in brightly colored paper and tied with glittery ribbon. Some are in tiny boxes, but some are guns, of course. They are all meticulously labeled.\n\n\"I think these are the presents you are giving out to friends this year, no?\" I ask with a wink.\n\nBanshee gives one brisk nod as he turns over the labels, reading them. I observe that some have detailed instructions. The Exo shrugs.\n\n\"Got in the habit of writing everything down. Sometimes I… I don't always remember.\" He waves the thought away. \"Right.\"\n\n\"I still need my supplies? The boxes I came to get?\" I nudge him.\n\nHe tilts his head a moment and finally raises a finger. \"Oh. I know where they are.\"\n\nBut before he takes away his boxes, I tap the covers. \"You should label them. 'Old Dawning Gifts.' 'New Dawning Gifts—To Be Delivered.'\" He nods at me and scribbles on the lids.\n\n\"I never forget my friends for the Dawning,\" he makes sure to tell me as he hands me my packages.\n\n\"I'm very glad. Happy Dawning, Banshee!\" I reply, squeezing his arm.\n\nI do hope he remembers to get rid of those chocolates.\n\n---\n\nTelemetry Tapioca:\nMix Vex Milk and Bullet Spray, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.",

        "description": "Sometimes, when I face something frightening, I think of the strongest people I know and draw strength from them. Suraya Hawthorne is one of those people. I know her brusque attitude can be off-putting, and that's intentional on her part. But once you get past that, there is so much to learn.\n\nShe was orphaned as a young girl, and Devrim and Marc took her in. Honestly, I think having these two as role models is part of why she's as strong as she is. They raised her to be sure of herself and to always do what she thought was right… even though that ultimately led to her having to leave the City.\n\nAs Suraya tells it, she came home one day to find Marc and Devrim sitting at the kitchen table, as though expecting her. They had her sit down, then asked if there was anything she wanted to tell them.\n\nShe shook her head. \"Nope.\"\n\nMarc asked her to try again, but she was silent, so he told her that Executor Hideo had stopped by their home. She asked how he was.\n\n\"You know how he is,\" Devrim said. \"Tell us what happened.\"\n\n\"His face got in the way.\"\n\nMarc took a deep breath and said Hideo claimed to have caught her stealing supplies that morning, and did she have anything to say about that? She did not.\n\nHe reminded her that stealing supplies and breaking a faction leader's nose were both good ways to get kicked out of the City, and Suraya could keep quiet no longer. She almost shouted her explanation: The factions didn't care about the people who needed food and supplies—the people who could not pledge to a faction because they were too busy struggling to survive. She wanted to help them, so she would sometimes steal supplies from New Monarchy.\n\nDevrim asked, \"What about Hideo?\"\n\nSuraya rolled her eyes and groaned, explained that when Hideo had found her, he'd said all manner of nasty, evil things to her: She was worthless, she was nothing, things like that.\n\nDevrim agreed Hideo was… well, I won't repeat it, but suffice to say it means \"an unpleasant person.\" He held a lot of influence, though, and he was insisting Suraya be punished. Harshly. For Suraya's part, this seemed to crystallize something. She tells me that's the first time she knew she wanted to leave the City—that perhaps this had been part of why she'd punched Hideo. She told her guardians and they couldn't believe it.\n\nThey were quiet for a bit. Then Devrim broke the silence. \"Well, let's get packed.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"Absolutely not.\" She was not about to let her decisions hurt these men who had taken her in and cared for her. They'd done nothing wrong.\n\nOh, they fought her. As she tells it, they argued a long time, until finally, she shrugged and said, \"If you try to come with me, I'll run away.\"\n\nShe suspected they knew there was no bluff to call, as they spoke now in tired, worried voices, making their case one last time. Suraya was adamant. \"I won't let you suffer for my choices.\" What could they do?\n\nShe asked when she had to leave. Marc said he could hold off Hideo for a day or two so they could all make a plan. His voice became stern again, and he said, \"You're going somewhere close enough that we can come and check on you as often as we like. At least for a while. That is nonnegotiable.\"\n\nHe had no negotiating power, of course. But Suraya had agreed. She stayed very near the City for over a year before saying proper goodbyes and heading out further into the world. \n\nSuraya Hawthorne is, in my mind, the definition of doing what you think is right regardless of the consequences. She knew it was right to help struggling families, she knew it was right to not put Devrim and Marc in harm's way, and she knew it was right to give them some peace of mind by staying close. That is the kind of true courage I have always admired.\n\n---\n\nEliksni Birdseed:\nMix Ether Cane and Personal Touch, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.",

He'd come by from time to time, to check in on everyone and make sure everything was going all right. We even sat down to tea a few times. Such a kind, sincere soul. We need more of those, you know.\n\nWe talked many times about the war, and he tried so hard to convince me to arm myself. \"You've seen what's out there,\" he would say, as though I might have forgotten.\n\nWe argued about it time and time again. I had jobs that didn't require fighting, I would explain, and that was intentional. My strongest contributions lay elsewhere, and I meant to keep my focus there.\n\nI remember one conversation in particular where Devrim was absolutely adamant. \"Eva!\" he finally said, louder than I think he meant to. His eyes were urgent, almost angry, as they locked on mine. \"This isn't some 'what if' situation. You've already had to defend yourself. It stands to reason you'll have to again. The Cabal aren't backing down, and they're not the only threat. To know all that and still not even try to protect yourself… it's irresponsible.\"\n\nYes, I had defended myself. And I had hated everything about it.\n\n\"Devrim.\" I kept my voice soft, but my words clear. \"The fighting, the shooting, the mayhem—that's not what I want to be part of. I've seen enough. If it comes for me again—and I agree, it could—then so be it. I want to be part of the healing. I want to be part of what builds us back up. Don't we need that?\"\n\nPoor Devrim finally stopped trying to convince me. He never stopped checking in, though. Old habits, as they say.\n\nWhen I finally came back to the Tower, though, what do you think was waiting for me? The Dawning festival was just beginning, and the Postmaster had a package for me. Inside, a beautiful sidearm—ornate design, antique coloring—and a note. From Devrim, of course.\n\nAt first I was indignant—after all our conversations! I had half a mind to simply throw this gun away. Instead, I read the note.\n\n\"Eva, my friend!\n\nI was sorry to hear you'd left the Farm after all, but very glad to know you'll be among dear friends. In that spirit, and in the spirit of the Dawning, I wanted to offer you this gift. This has been passed down through my family for generations. It's a Kay family heirloom—and before you throw it away, you should know that it doesn't fire. I thought this might be a nice compromise, and I hope you'll accept it.\n\nI hope the Tower treats you well, old friend.\n\n—Devrim\"\n\nI read the note a few more times, then folded it and put it in my pocket.\n\nI looked down once more at this beautiful heirloom—a symbol of friendship, of family—and reflected on the fact that somehow, despite everything, I'd managed to rediscover both.\n\n---\n\nGentleman's Shortbread:\nMix Ether Cane and Perfect Taste, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.",

        "description": "Every Dawning, I receive many greeting cards from customers. The ones I treasure the most contain stories about how people all across our solar system observe the holiday. One of my favorite letters came from someone who was a customer of mine but once: Lady Sloane, Stoneborn out on Titan, one of Saturn's moons.\n\n\"Dear Eva,\n\n\"Happy Dawning.\n\n\"First, thanks for the delivery; all the requisitions arrived in perfect condition, and you did a great job packaging up the chicken (more on that later). We tried decorating the railings outside our Command Center with the garlands, but the Fallen have been using the lights for target practice. I guess we'll be getting some more next year and prettying up the break room instead. A couple of the Dawning lanterns got whipped away in the wind, too—we're not known for our clement weather out here on the methane seas.\n\n\"Some Guardians who've been helping me out on Titan mentioned that you like to hear about Dawning traditions outside the City, so here's how we celebrate on this moon we call home.\n\n\"This year, I let the crew off duty early, 1600 hours, and took a whole hour off myself so we could have ourselves a little Dawning soirée in our Command Center.\n\n\"Siren's Watch has got quite a view of the waves and some floating platforms, so we pushed our break room tables together, end to end, and looked out at the horizon while we shared a communal feast. Seeing as the room is exposed to the elements (the glass view window broke long ago, but repairing it just hasn't been a priority), Del and Ari had to bundle up—and we had to weigh the tablecloth down with chunks of metal. I've had worse setups.\n\n\"Eva, it was the best meal I've had in ages. That chicken? Delicious. Every one of us got to try a piece. We cut our protein rations into fun shapes, and once we got your taffy warmed up enough to chew, it was heaven.\n\n\"We exchanged Dawning gifts as well. Somebody even cross-stitched me an 'inspirational quote' to hang in my quarters ('Where's my beacon?'; it's an in-joke). Decent tools, Heavy ammo, thick socks—those are the kinds of gifts that change hands out here. Maybe that doesn't impress people accustomed to the Dawning in the Tower, but those presents have worth to us.\n\n\"When we joined hands afterward, whether for warmth or just conviviality, we got to talking in a way we never really had before. I don't think I've ever voluntarily shared stories about myself in my life! We talked about who we were before the Red War, where we came from, and even where we might want to go in the future.\n\n\"It's not easy here on this storm-tossed moon—one jolt and you're tumbling off a platform into eternity. Between the Fallen and the Hive and the elements, we're always just struggling to stay alive. But as we sat there chatting, we FELT alive.\n\n\"I guess I wrote all this just to say thank you, Eva, for reminding us to take a moment to appreciate and rejoice, no matter what. I find that inspiring.\n\n\"Sincerely,\n\"Sloane\"\n\nI have never left Earth, and Titan sounds like a… very interesting place. But reading how this holiday has brought people together in such faraway places, I feel all my efforts have been worth it.\n\nI hope to see Sloane again someday.\n\n---\n\nAlkane Dragée Cookies:\nMix Chitin Powder and Bullet Spray, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.",

        "description": "I had heard of the Exodus colony ships before. I didn't remember much about them—just one of those names from history lessons that sticks with you. To tell you the truth, I had forgotten about it until more recently, when some Guardians told me they found one of them crashed on Nessus—and explained what had happened to its Failsafes.\n\nI understand they were originally one AI—the ship's navigational intelligence—but with time, they separated. It sounds to me like one of them is always happy, and the other is always sad. That's no way to live for either of them. These things must exist in balance. I know they're computers, but I worry for them.\n\nOne Guardian in particular spoke to me recently of the time he told the Failsafes about the Dawning festival. He had just turned some bounties in to them and mentioned that he was excited to get back to Earth to participate in the festivities. They stopped him and asked him to explain what that meant—they had never heard of the Dawning! He said something to the effect of, \"It's a winter celebration that combines several old Earth traditions.\"\n\nThey responded—I will try to word this exactly as he did, since he prided himself on his imitation of them—they responded by the happy one saying, \"According to my database, Earth's 'winter' occurs when one hemisphere is oriented away from the sun! Why do you celebrate being cold?\" Then the sad one said, \"I mean, I can't feel cold, but it sounds awful.\"\n\nSo this Guardian said something like, \"It's more that we're celebrating each other,\" which I love, because that is how I've always thought of it as well. We're all here together, eating sweets and being with each other.\n\nThe Failsafes asked a few more questions and then the happy one said, \"If we are celebrating each other, how can I participate in the Dawning? I am all alone. It is very depressing!\" The sad one said, \"I'm not gonna celebrate the Fallen.\"\n\nMy Guardian friend thought quickly and said, \"You can wish every Guardian that comes out to Nessus a happy Dawning! Celebrate with us! We would love that.\"\n\nThat seemed to cheer both of them up a bit, so I'm glad he thought to say it. Apparently, they practiced wishing him a happy Dawning for the better part of an hour, so I expect they're quite good at it now. Go visit them if you have a chance.

        "description": "\"Eva Levante!\" Ikora caught my wrist and leaned in to whisper. \"I need to speak with you about Eris Morn.\"\n\nAh, I will never forget that day. Way back then, I was very busy getting the Vanguard and the other Tower vendors excited about the Dawning. In turn, many reached out to me about anything related to the holiday. Still, I was surprised that the Warlock Vanguard would seek me out—and to talk about Eris Morn, of all people!\n\nI might have shuddered in spite of myself.\n\n\"I saw you chatting with her as you were getting the decorations set up…\"\n\nWhat I recalled was Eris talking at me about abysses while I was trying to hang lanterns, but I did not want to say that to Ikora.\n\nShe continued, \"I am worried about her. She seems quite depressed.\"\n\nI flicked my eyes up at Ikora and then looked away. To my credit, I did not snort.\n\n\"She's even more morose than usual, and the technicians in the Hall of Guardians are complaining. Eva, could you talk to her? Perhaps… get her to help you out? Surely you could use an extra set of hands.\"\n\nA terrible idea, but again, I could not say so. Instead I suggested, \"Perhaps she has a friend—well, maybe not a 'friend'—but somebody she likes to talk to, someone who she has something in common with…\" I trailed off, remembering who we were speaking of.\n\nBut Ikora perked up. \"There is someone she addresses voluntarily—a Gensym scribe named Asher Mir. He's also, well… He's an excellent scholar. I'll reach out to him, unless YOU know him, of course…\"\n\n\"I don't!\" I said brightly. \"But I hope it goes well; I want everybody to have a happy Dawning. Now if you'll excuse me, I do have deliveries to make.\"\n\nI wasn't yet familiar enough with Ikora to squeeze her arm in farewell, so I nodded and made my escape.\n\nBut when I crossed paths with her again later that day, what a look she gave me! \"I talked to Asher, as you suggested,\" she muttered.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"He grumbled at first. He seemed unaware that the Dawning was taking place, in fact. But I explained, and when I told him it would be… very well regarded if he wrote her a Dawning greeting card or went to visit her, he said he could write a card. He also said he had a Dawning gift for her.\"\n\n\"Oh! How kind!\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure,\" she sighed and produced a piece of parchment.\n\nIt was folded in four to form a greeting card. Nothing on the cover, but inside was written, \"Eris, the Warlock Vanguard has approached me about 'cheering you up' for a holiday that is going on. I shall seize this serendipitous opportunity to send you the research notes you demanded of me on heretical practices among the Hive, however spurious the grounds for your request. Warmest wishes to you this Dawning! —Asher Mir\"\n\n\"Did you dictate that last part to him, Ikora?\"\n\nShe paused for a moment. \"Yes.\"\n\nI laughed. \"Well, you had better take it to her. I wouldn't call Hive research a traditional Dawning present, but she did request it.\"\n\nIkora shook her head wearily, and we parted ways.\n\nLater that same day, as I was about to head out on my last round of deliveries, Ikora approached me yet again.\n\nShe told me, \"I went to see Eris. I don't know if she's any more cheerful, although she did say, 'Ah yes, I had been expecting these notes for some time now. Good.' She even wrote a Dawning message back to Asher.\"\n\nIkora handed me back the same piece of parchment that her scribe colleague had used, but it had been refolded. I read, \"Asher: Take heed not to succumb to the whispers, as fools do. Warmest wishes to you this Dawning! —Eris Morn\"\n\nI shrugged.\n\nThe Warlock cleared her throat. \"Eris also had a Dawning gift for me to pass on to Asher.\"\n\n\"At least she's making an effort.\"\n\n\"Well…\" Ikora hauled me aside and took out a small, lumpy packet wrapped in cloth. She peeled back the layers of tissue with care. And there it was. The Dawning gift glowed with a sickly green luminescence.\n\n\"I can't give this to him!\" Ikora hissed. \"I can just...\" She looked around for eavesdroppers. \"...get rid of it, right?\"\n\n\"This is beyond a question of Dawning etiquette,\" I whispered back.\n\nShe nodded, her face set. \"Let us never speak of this again.\"\n\n---\n\nRadiolarian Pudding:\nMix Vex Milk and Electric Flavor, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.",

How I jumped!\n\nIt was… a certain well-known Titan—not Zavala, but I will not tell you who. Eva Levante does not tattle about sensitive matters.\n\nHe was carrying a formidable piece of weaponry, a complicated curve of many metal parts with a thick string connecting the ends. \"It's a compound bow,\" he explained, following my stare. \"For shooting arrows.\" I raised my eyebrows in puzzlement.\n\nOn that weapon, he had placed a large pouf of red velvet ribbon. A bow on a bow.\n\nI could tell from the tilt of his helmet and his taut grip on the weapon that something was amiss.\n\nI sighed. I saw this a few times every Dawning. I suspected he was smitten, and this would not be a short conversation.\n\n\"Warmest Dawning greetings to you, Torito!\" (That is not his actual name, naturally; it is a made-up name.)\n\n\"Eva Levante. They say you should give a Dawning gift when you… have a special friend,\" he boomed, trying to whisper.\n\n\"Who is 'they'?\" I laughed.\n\nHe ignored me. \"I bought my friend this bow. Is it a good gift?\"\n\n\"It all depends on your friend. What do they like? What ARE they like? Can you describe them?\"\n\n\"She… likes to fight. She is regal. She is very…\" The Titan paused. \"Is a recurve bow more romantic than a compound bow?\" (He managed to whisper this time.)\n\n\"Ahhh,\" I nodded knowingly. I wouldn't know the difference between those weapons, but I understood his problem.\n\n\"But maybe a book would be better?\" he asked.\n\n\"Again, it depends which book you choose.\"\n\n\"I have read Ikora's 'On Circles: Revised Edition,' and it was very good.\"\n\n\"That is a terrible Dawning gift. Might I suggest literature?\"\n\nTorito tapped the horn on his helmet to reflect. \"I did destroy a book of hers once. Should I replace it?\"\n\n\"Maybe you should not remind her of a bad thing happening…\"\n\nHe didn't reply to this, so I went on, \"Perhaps this bow is already the right Dawning gift for your friend. Do you think she would use it?\"\n\n\"Definitely.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" I smiled, \"you have your answer. Happy Dawning to you and your friend both!\"\n\n\"And to you, Eva. I hope your Dawning is one to remember.\"\n\nThen the Titan thanked me, hefted the bow, and strode off.\n\n---\n\nVanilla Blades:\nMix Cabal Oil and Sharp Flavor, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.",

        "description": "I always seem to get a customer with many questions right as things get busiest, in the late afternoon. Today it was a woman. A beautiful, sturdy Guardian with dark, cropped hair and a diagonal stripe of white across each eye—very striking! She had a satchel slung over one shoulder and a stack of books and packages cradled in one arm. By this, I guessed she was a paying customer. She also had a cheeky curl to her lip and a hand on her hip, and she tap-tap-tapped her fingers as she waited. By this, I guessed she was a Hunter.\n\n\"Happy Dawning, Miss…?\" I greeted her.\n\nShe launched right in. \"Can you help me put together a really small, intimate Dawning celebration? Do you have, like, a kit or something?\" she asked, peering back over her shoulder with impatience. \"It's a surprise for… somebody who's used to the Dawning in the City, only now we're all the way over on Mars, so…\"\n\n\"Ah! Well, the Dawning basics are decorations, shared food, and gifts. First: you have a choice of lanterns\"—I pointed to the colorful spheres lining the shop—\"and candles\"—I produced a box of tea candles from under the counter and thumped it down in front of her—\"and streamers.\"\n\n\"Candles and streamers are a fire hazard. I'll take candles and lanterns.\"\n\n\"Silver and yellow lanterns go well together…\"\n\nShe squinted up at my display. \"Purple.\"\n\n\"I'll give you purple, green, and silver. That's a pretty combination. The Dawning is about wonder and beauty, so you don't buy just one lantern.\" I stacked the accordioned lanterns on top of the candles.\n\nShe opened her mouth and then shut it again. I pulled out my biggest assortment of Dawning treats and placed it on the counter. \"Sharing and generosity are the heart of the Dawning. This collection is the one you want\"—here I paused—\"if you want to impress someone you love.\"\n\nShe pursed her lips and pushed the beribboned package of sweets next to the candles and lanterns.\n\nSmiling, I pulled over a rack of my finer garments. \"Finally, the Dawning gift: the most important—\"\n\n\"Oh, I've already got a good Dawning gift.\" She put her belongings on the counter to point out the necklace box on top. I also happened to scan the spines of the thick books, some with very long titles, all labeled, \"Fu'an Library – REFERENCE – DO NOT REMOVE.\"\n\nThe Hunter noticed my frown and shoved the books into her satchel. \"Here's what I picked. Think she'll like it?\"\n\nI didn't know who 'she' was. But I admired the necklace she was showing off: an elongated pendant with an emblem of a little bird, of exquisite workmanship.\n\nShe grinned, \"That design is Golden Age, but the pendant also holds thirty-five petabytes of data!\"\n\nI returned her smile. I also convinced her to buy a sturdy book bag and purple wrapping paper.\n\n\"There! Your own personal Dawning in a bag!\" I said, tucking away her Glimmer and handing over her purchases. \"I hope your companion enjoys the surprise.\"\n\nThe Hunter bobbed her head in thanks and turned to go.\n\n\"Anastasia!\"\n\nWho did I see then but Commander Zavala, standing arms akimbo in the corridor as the press of the afternoon shopping crowd flowed around him.\n\n\"Zavala,\" muttered the Hunter. She pushed her shoulders back and thrust out her chin; she looked fierce as a falcon.\n\n\"Happy Dawning, Ana. I'm surprised to see you in the Tower.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, I had errands…\"\n\nBut I missed what else they said, because someone ran up with a package, asking, \"Hey, did I hear that woman was headed back to Mars? This one's going there, too.\"\n\nI ran my eyes down the packing list: candles, lanterns, candy assortment, wrapping paper, cloak… Ordered by a Camrin Dumuzi. I got a funny feeling, it was such a coincidence…\n\n\"I think this is meant to be a surprise. The package can wait for tomorrow's deliveries,\" I replied.\n\nWhen I looked back, Zavala and the Hunter were deep in conversation, the Titan Vanguard wearing a half smile and the woman smirking. By this, I guessed that the Dawning spirit was uniting old friends.\n\nAnd with that, I turned to my next customer.\n\n---\n\nJavelin Mooncake:\nMix Chitin Powder and Sharp Flavor, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.",

The different varieties can be hard to recognize when you're young, but with time, you'll see them all. The rarest form is genuine kindness, though there is also \"fair weather\" friendly, \"I want something\" friendly, and \"look how friendly I am\" friendly. That last one is always hiding something, and they hope their performance covers it up.\n\nThis last group is also where we find that man who calls himself the Drifter. I do not like to speak ill of others, but him? Him I do not trust.\n\nI don't really know what he does out beyond that gate, and I'm not sure I want to know. I've spoken to him only a couple of times. He always seems like he's in a rush.\n\nThe one conversation we've had beyond our introduction was very short, and he slinked away before I could get any answers. It was right before the start of the Dawning festival. I was getting my decorations set up as he walked up to my booth and asked, \"Well, what's all this?\"\n\n\"Surely you know of the Dawning?\" I said—not in a rude way, but in a friendly way. \"I know you're a snake\" friendly.\n\n\"Oh, of course,\" he said. \"I guess I'd forgotten it was gettin' to be that season. Time just goes right on by, don't it, sister? Right on by.\" He looked up at the decorations for a long time, hands on his hips and nodding approvingly.\n\n\"It certainly can,\" I said. \"Actually, I wanted to ask—\"\n\n\"You know,\" he said, \"I don't know that I've been anywhere that actually celebrated the Dawning. Why don't you tell me a thing or two?\"\n\nI may not be centuries old, my friend, but I am no naïve child either. Old Eva knows a lie when she hears it. I spent a bit of time telling him about our festival anyway, explaining our traditions and the meanings behind them. He nodded along, seemingly very attentive. I tried to bring the conversation back to him.\n\n\"So, Drifter, where are you—\"\n\n\"Well, best be on my way!\" he said, pretending not to hear me as he backed up. \"I've taken up enough of your time—who knows how much any of us has left.\" As he walked off, he tossed back, \"Like the décor! Good colors!\" then disappeared around a corner.\n\nI've heard other people talk about this strange man. They mostly say the same things: very friendly, if a little mysterious. On the other hand, I've also heard some things I won't repeat—they're far too gruesome to be true, and I won't facilitate spreading false rumors. I'm sure his eating habits are no different from yours or mine.\n\nSuffice to say, something is off about him. I'd recommend keeping an eye on him.\n\n---\n\nDark Chocolate Motes:\nMix Taken Butter and Null Taste, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.",

        "description": "What I have loved most since coming back to the Tower is reconnecting with everyone. I missed my friends while I was away, and I thought about them every day. Even when you're doing what you know is right, it can be hard not to wish for times past.\n\nI've wanted so much to catch up on everything I missed, but these Guardians are so busy, always flitting in and out. You can barely get a word out of them most of the time. I feel like so much has happened, but I get only drips of information.\n\n\"Spider\" is a name I hear over and over, but who is he? A common criminal? A deity? A friend? Some accounts paint him as all three. What is it about this Spider fellow that compels these Guardians so?\n\nAnd do I have it right that he feeds on Ghosts? Ghosts! What an utterly despicable practice. Even the most detestable Ghost doesn't deserve that kind of treatment. (Yes, I am thinking of one in particular, but… I'm afraid old Eva will keep that secret to herself.)\n\nFrom what I can put together, this Spider fellow had a group of Barons, I think. If that's correct, his relationship with them seemed… tenuous. I don't know what one gets up to on this Tangled Shore, but I think he had them all killed.\n\nBefore that, though, Spider's Barons broke into some kind of high-security prison out in space. They were looking for… something belonging to Spider. I don't know what it was. Maybe it was Ghosts or maybe it was weapons—although why he'd have someone look for those things in a prison, I don't know. While his Barons were in there, the prisoners started to fight them. That rascal Cayde-6 was also in the prison, on a mission that I don't think was related to Spider's mission. They ended up in the same fight, though, from what it sounds like. Then, while everyone was fighting, the Reef Queen's brother arrived!\n\nWhen I first heard this story, at this point I thought to myself, \"Oh, good! Finally someone on our side. The Awoken Prince will help get things in order.\" Now, keep in mind that I had always heard he was… a bit stiff. But also that he was willing to help when it came down to it. That was before his sister, though. Loss can do terrible, ugly things to us.\n\nThis leads me to the only detail I know with absolute certainty: Uldren Sov killed Cayde-6.\n \nI don't know why, but I suspect it was in part because the Prince succumbed to the pain in his heart and lost the ability to see things as they are. Anyway, once Spider's Barons left the prison, they ran all over the Reef. I guess they had found what Spider was looking for, but decided to keep those things for themselves. This Spider sent people after the Barons, and I don't think any of the Barons survived.\n\nWhile all this was going on, someone killed Uldren. I assume it was revenge for Cayde, but I can't get anyone to tell me with certainty who did it. Based on everything else I hear about this Spider, I wonder if Uldren wasn't also his work.\n\nMany of my Guardian friends are still doing favors for this… creature who, at best, betrays his own people. I am not sure that road leads anywhere good. Though perhaps I don't have the whole truth.\n\nThis is no history lesson. Take it however you will. Some people just don't have time to talk to old Eva, it seems.\n\n---\n\nCandy Dead Ghosts:\nMix Dark Ether Cane and Flash of Inspiration, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.",

        "description": "What are the Awoken?\n\nNot in the sense of \"how did they come to be?\" I don't care about that any more than about how the Cabal or the Fallen came to be. As far as I'm concerned, the universe decided it wanted them, and so it made them. Who am I to question the universe?\n\nI've heard people talk about Petra Venj and the Tangled Shore lately. It's very confusing—roped-together rocks? And you just… jump between them? It's no wonder that Reefborn Awoken are so often suspicious of others if they grow up unable to even trust the ground!\n\nBut the Awoken as a whole… I feel like my grasp of them has certainly grown, but there are things I still don't understand. They are certainly part of what we consider \"humanity,\" just as much as Humans or Exos. I know this and believe it, but what makes it so?\n\nIs it because they are… made… like we are? The Cabal are built roughly as we are, but we do not consider them part of humanity.\n\nIs it our shared relationship with the Traveler? As hard as it is to believe, I have heard the Fallen had a relationship with the Traveler. But they are not part of humanity. \n\nDoes \"humanity\" consider only those who choose to walk among Humans? But by that logic, Reefborn Awoken who remain in the Reef are not part of humanity. I don't believe that's true, and yet…\n\nPetra has spent most of her life in the Reef, hasn't she? I know she was here playing Emissary for a while, but she has always considered the Reef her true home. Would she describe herself as part of humanity? I think if you walked up to Petra and asked, \"Are you a member of humanity?\" she would respond, \"I am an Awoken of the Reef.\" If you pressed her further and asked, \"Yes, but which side are you on?\" I believe she would say, \"The side of Queen Mara Sov.\"\n\nSo then is humanity something we choose? Or is it ascribed to you? Is it a title to be earned or a birthright, a heritage? Are the Awoken part of humanity due to one of these stipulations, or—\n\nCould it be that the Awoken are part of humanity because of ALL of these stipulations? Individually, these ideas don't define humanity any more than a cloak defines a Hunter, but COLLECTIVELY—that they are built as we are, that they share our relationship with the Traveler, and that many of them gladly walk among us here on Earth… Maybe THAT is what makes them part of humanity—everything bound together, just as we are all bound together.\n\nThat togetherness is what helped us win the Red War, and I truly believe it will help us push back the Darkness for good. Never forget that our unity is what makes us strong, and the Awoken will always be part of that.\n\n---\n\nIll-Fortune Cookies:\nMix Dark Ether Cane and Impossible Heat, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.",

        "description": "There is a strange fellow who… well, perhaps you've seen him. He doesn't really come and go as you or I might traditionally think. It's more that you turn around, and he is either there or he is not. His appearances are steady and predictable, at least. He's called Xûr. I'm not sure why one draws the tiny arrow over his name, but it's important to try and respect the wishes of those we don't understand.\n\nThe first time I ever saw Xûr, I was by myself at my stall in the Tower. The Old Tower, I suppose you'd call it now. I hadn't been there long at all. I looked up, and this man had appeared, seemingly out of nowhere! His back was to me, but even from behind, something seemed off about him. Something in his posture. As he started to turn, I noticed his whole face appeared to be covered in hair. It even seemed to be moving, gently flowing on its own—but there was no wind.\n\nWhen the light hit his face, I screamed and ducked down behind part of my cabinets. I was sure this abomination had come to invade us, that more of them were just out of sight, that we were done for.\n\nEventually, I realized no one else was screaming. I heard no sounds of distress. I peeked out and saw that everyone was going about their business. No one was panicking but me! Many people saw him—several were interacting with him.\n\nSlowly, I stood back up and tried to go about my business—though I rarely looked away. Tess came over before too long, and I asked her about the strange figure.\n\n\"Oh, that's Xûr!\" she said, unconcerned. \"He comes through every so often and sells particular, hard-to-find things.\" She considered him for a moment, then added, \"Could do with a bit of a wardrobe update, if you ask me, but he's otherwise harmless.\"\n\n\"What is he?\" I asked. \"I've never seen a creature like that before.\"\n\n\"Xûr is… I believe he's called a Jovian. They're from out beyond even the Reef. I'm afraid I don't know much else about them.\"\n\n\"But they're… friendly?\"\n\n\"Well, they don't attack us, if that's what you mean. I don't know that I'd call Xûr friendly, but he's not hostile.\"\n\nI felt more at ease after our conversation, though I still could not shake my fear. For many months, I jumped every time I saw him and had to fight back the instinct to hide.\n\nEventually, I grew used to his presence. I even began to appreciate his predictability—it became a symbol that everything was functioning as it should. The fear evaporated with time.\n\nI have often found that my first reaction to new things is fear. Perhaps it is this way for everyone. However, I have also found that if I accept and acknowledge my fear, it is easier to push through until I am no longer afraid. The new thing has almost never been as frightening as I first feared.\n\n---\n\nStrange Cookies:\nMix Taken Butter and Electric Flavor, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.",

        "description": "Late one evening, I was shuffling home after a long day of Dawning preparations. It was a popular night for parties, so I was threading my way through the crowds on my weary old feet, enjoying the laughter and flushed faces of those I passed.\n\nA roar of many voices drew my attention to the open window of a large chamber packed with merrymakers. I asked myself, now who could that be, causing all that noise? Ay! Believe it or not, it was the Cryptarchs!\n\nThey were playing some kind of game, someone holding up an engram, people shouting out comical guesses about what was inside—I don't know what Cryptarchs find fun, honestly. But I saw the door open and someone with a hood slip out very quickly and vanish into the crowd. I remember chuckling to myself, that's somebody making an escape, all right!\n\nBy now, many of the festivities were winding down, and the streets overflowed with oh-so-lively residents of our Tower. I could barely set one sore foot in front of the other in the press of people! So it was that I found myself almost shoulder to shoulder with the Cryptarch who'd fled the party. Even though he was pulling his hood down to conceal his face, I recognized him: Master Rahool.\n\nI wasn't the only one to do so.\n\n\"Hey Rahool, get any blues from a purple this Dawning?\" someone yelled, to a chorus of raucous laughs. I didn't understand, but he looked taken aback.\n\nThen, approaching from the opposite direction, some young people with that scruffy, bright-eyed look of students started tapping one another on the shoulder and pointing. They pushed one boy forward, and he stared intently at Rahool, scrunching up his face. The Cryptarch must have sensed the young scholar meant to accost him, because he tried to head the other way in the throng. No luck, of course.\n\n\"Master Rahool, Happy Dawning!\" I heard the youth begin. \"Me and my friends, we're just beginning our studies in cryptography, and we had this theory about Ulan—\"\n\nAt this point, I told myself, Eva, you have to save him.\n\nI made a great push through the masses and hooked my arm into poor Rahool's. \"I need the Cryptarch's help!\" I chirped at the students, with an apologetic shrug. Then I hauled Rahool toward a side street. I may be petite, but after decades of walking through the City, I can move through a crowd when I want to.\n\nWe ducked through alleys and passages until I found an empty courtyard. \"I think we can wait out the crowds here,\" I told the Cryptarch, who gave a curt nod. My feet were throbbing at this point, so I threw myself down on a bench, removed my slippers, and began to rub my aching soles. Rahool stood there staring at his own feet like he was contemplating the infinite universe.\n\nFinally I looked around to get my bearings. \"Oh!\" I exclaimed, pointing. \"Turn around, Cryptarch!\"\n\nRahool followed my gaze. Above our heads, strings of shining globes and jewel-colored lanterns traced bright lines across a sky of deep-blue velvet. Below us stretched the twinkling lights of the City. The soothing curve of the Traveler was just visible.\n\nRahool seated himself beside me, and we settled into an amicable silence, with only the occasional rustle of a Dawning banner whipping in the breeze to break the calm. My feet gradually ceased to ache.\n\nFinally, after minutes or hours, I stood and slipped my shoes on again. \"I must go home and sleep,\" I told him, raising a hand in farewell. \"I think the streets will be empty now.\"\n\nThe Cryptarch's face twitched in what I imagine was an attempt to smile. \"Happy Dawning, Eva Levante.\" he managed.\n\nWhen I departed, he was seated still, hands folded neatly on his lap and a serene face tilted toward the heavens.\n\n---\n\nBurnt Edge Transits:\nMix two ingredients that do not successfully combine, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.",

He was one of the first people to greet me when I arrived at the Tower all those years ago—though I suppose \"greet\" may be too soft a word. It implies a sort of friendliness, a warmth. And Zavala… if you've never met him? He can be a bit stern. He's hardened further since the Red War, I'm sorry to see—though I suppose we all have, to some degree. In any case, that very first meeting left a sour taste in my mouth. I hate to admit that I avoided Zavala when I could after that—though sometimes he makes himself unavoidable.\n\nIt wasn't long after this meeting that I celebrated my first Dawning at the Tower. Everyone's spirits were high, and it was so nice to see the people I had come to care about smiling and toasting each other. I remember Tess and I had just finished with a bit of decorating, and she had left to get something when Zavala began heading my way. \"Oh no,\" I thought. \"Oh no, not this man.\" Ah, but he came over anyway, so I smiled and wished him a Happy Dawning—because I DID wish good things for him. It is often the sternest among us who hold the saddest hearts.\n\nHe wished me the same, and then—I almost couldn't believe it—he smiled! We exchanged some brief pleasantries, and… I don't remember what I said that brought this on, but suddenly he said, \"Oh, that reminds me of a joke!\"\n\nA joke! At first I thought I must have heard him wrong, because the Titan Vanguard had always struck me as the \"no time for joking\" sort. But he had barely begun telling this story before I noticed how much more relaxed his posture was. It seemed the spirit of the Dawning had reached even this stone man.\n\nI remember only pieces of the joke these days—I believe it had to do with a Guardian and a Fallen Captain?—but I clearly remember that he stumbled over the first few words and had to start again. I gave the warmest smile I could to encourage him, and he went on to tell one of the longest, most awkward jokes I have ever heard. And listen, I loved every minute of it. Truly, I couldn't have been happier. Oh, I clapped and laughed along with what I swear was real, true joy from Zavala. To have such a guarded soul open like that—few things are more beautiful. I admired him so in that moment, that he could push himself beyond the boundaries he'd held himself to. I remember hoping that I could someday be so brave in my own way. For the first time, I didn't just respect him as one of the City leaders. For the first time, I felt real, genuine affection for Zavala, the person.

They were Risen, beings said to be unkillable, and they fought against each other in a war without end somewhere beyond Eaton's borders. This particular group, the Iron Lords, represented new ideology, and claimed they fought to put an end to the fighting.\n\nLed by a man named Dryden, they had paid each family in Eaton several months' worth of supplies and rations to stay the week. They planned to stage an ambush on another of their kind, known only as the Red Man.\n\nTwo weeks ago, survival was in doubt. Now, because of the generosity of the Iron Lords, their little town would make it through the winter.\n\nGermaine's friend Judson emerged from a neighboring supply shed and stuck a single finger in the air as the riders strode up. Germaine chuckled and shook his head, but said nothing.\n\n\"How you livin',\" Judson  greeted the Risen, holding his finger high.\n\n\"Settle down, Judson,\" Germaine called out.\n\n\"Shut your hole, Germaine,\" Judson returned, hand still in the air. \"Your name is stupid, and you're stupid, too.\"\n\nGermaine shook his head and grinned ruefully.\n\nJudson had warned the town against the arrangement, shouting to everyone who would listen that he'd take care of food, that the \"iron freaks\" would only bring trouble. He was a very good huntsman—possibly the best Eaton had ever seen, and somehow produced deer, duck, and bull from the decimated hills. But even Judson had come up short for months. The war beyond Eaton had intensified. The adults went hungry so the children could eat. It wasn't a sustainable position.\n\n\"We'll be out of your way soon,\" said one of the Iron Lords, who nodded at Judson as he passed by. Her voice was as metallic and cold as her helmet.

Those things out there, you can't kill. Get that out of your mind right now.\"\n\nYu kept pacing, frowning slightly as she considered it.\n\n\"More food is nice, but Judson thinks they're going to get us dead. I think he might run away,\" she said.\n\nHe laid another card down. \"Appreciate what you get. Your parents were skipping dinner so you could have yours. The Risen solved that for us. For a little while. We have to let them stay.\"\n\nShe stopped pacing to consider it, and looked up at the sheet metal ceiling. \"I don't want to die.\"\n\n\"You won't,\" Germaine said. \"Why don't you go see what your parents are up to? I'm a little beat.\"\n\n\"OK,\" she said, shrugging. She left.\n\nGermaine opened a small box of water from the pile of ration packs and poured a tin-full. Yu hadn't noticed because it was difficult to see in the flickering lamplight, but his hands shook.\n\n**\n\nJudson's breath steamed in the night air as he shut the gate that bordered town as quietly as he could. Shivering would mean shaking the rickety thing and waking up Yu's family, so he kept the handle gripped tight as he pushed it back into place. He now stood on the pass out of Eaton Valley.\n\nAs he turned around, he walked right into Germaine.\n\n\"Didn't see you there, brother,\" Judson growled low, stopping just short of throwing an elbow into his neighbor's throat. He backed up a step. Just one.\n\n\"Where're you running to this late?\" Germaine asked. \"Brother.\"\n\n\"What are you, dense? Away from this before the shooting starts.\"\n\n\"We gotta trust this Lord Dryden knows what he's doing,\" Germaine said.\n\nJudson shook his head. \"You and all the deal-makers are gonna get this town dead. These guys are worse than the stories.\"\n\n\"You know how I feel about Risen, but they saved us this week.\"\n\nJudson sneered. \"No one ever believes it 'cuz Risen look like you and me, but they'll kill you without meaning to. Naturally as breathing. They can't help it.\"\n\n\"They're lookin' to jump one man. Just one. We gotta see this through. Even the Risen can contain a fight at that scale.\"\n\n\"You gonna move? Or do I move you?\"\n\nGermaine stepped to the side. \"I'm not the law. But where you gonna go? There's nothin' but war-land out there. And their prey is comin'.\"\n\n\"I'm a tracker. Kept this town fed for years before you got here. I'll be fine. And that other Risen won't care about one man passing through. I got nothing to hide. Just need to get away. If you all want to play bait for the warring dead, have a nice life.\"\n\nGermaine chuckled.\"What's funny?\" Judson sneered in that low voice again.\n\n\"I don't know how you do it. I almost admire you.\"\n\n\"How's that?\"\n\n\"You've got no fear. Have a nice life, brother. See you when I see you.\" Germaine walked back to the gate.",

Half the town came out to see them.\n\nOne of the men wore red armor that fit the description of the Warlord that Dryden and his Lords were waiting for.\n\nThey say that one Risen, reasonably armed, can annihilate an army. Two Risen, assuming adequate cover for Ghost support, can fight infinite armies indefinitely.\n\nSix Warlords dismounted their machines in a line at the center of town, weapons drawn. They dropped Judson on his knees in front of them. No restraints. He looked unhurt.\n\n\"Does anyone want to claim this runt?\" asked the Red Man.\n\n\"We will,\" Germaine said. People groaned. Yu tried to run to Judson, but her parents held her back.\n\n\"A question, first,\" said the Red Man. \"Where are the Iron Lords? We saw one of their Ghosts. One of these?\" He tapped the bladed carapace of his own drone companion as it floated past him, its eye fixed on the townspeople. \"They like to meddle. Maybe they helped you, brought you some food? It would explain how you survive out here in this wasteland. But I can guarantee you their motivations are not in your best interest.\" The Red Man paused, scanned the crowd as his Ghost orbited above him.\n\n\"The Iron Lords are trying to disrupt the established order. And we're here to liberate you from them. You're under our care, now. So. Where are they?\"\n\nGermaine shut his eyes a long moment. When no one else spoke, he decided he would. \"You're right. They were here. But they're long gone. We paid them for supplies and they moved on a week ago.\"\n\n\"Did they?\" The Red Man raised his hand cannon and shot Yu's father in the head. The entire crowd flinched and huddled together as the man fell backward. Yu's mother cried out in fury, but held her child tight.\n\n\"Hand to my heart,\" Germaine said, holding his breath as he waited for the hidden Iron Lords to make a move. The Red Man held his gun in the air, watching the townspeople intently. The other Warlords scanned the horizon, gleaming weapons at the ready.\n\nJudson took the pregnant pause as an opportunity to pull a Fallen shock blade from one of the Warlord machines. He gave a triumphant yell and decapitated the armored Risen closest to him. As the body fell, he jabbed the length of the blade through the Red Man's back. A third Warlord pulled the glaive out of Judson's hands and stabbed him in the side with a gauntlet blade, then hurled him backwards over the machines.\n\nAll hell broke loose around Germaine as the Iron Lords suddenly opened fire from their positions in the surrounding hills. The townspeople scattered as the fallen Warlords rose in scintillating pillars of Light, the weapons in their hands roaring to life and spitting tracers.\n\n**\n\nThe Ghost watched from high above the chaos. Over the ages, it had gotten very good at hiding. It had gotten very good at all the peculiar things its chosen had asked it to learn.\n\nDown below, gunfire and explosions of Light tore through the collection of huts and shacks. The townspeople fled for their lives in the midst of fire and otherworldly flame as the Iron Lords finally abandoned their sniper positions in the hills to close in on the Warlords at the town center.\n\nThrough it all, the Ghost saw one of the men emerge out of the discharge of an errant explosive device, cradling the body of a child. He moved to relative safety behind one of the shacks and knelt down, holding an ear to the child's face. She was trying to speak.\n\nOne of the armored riders in the town square raised a heavy machine gun in one hand and raked the length of Eaton with golden tracers. The Ghost lost visibility on the townspeople as the hail of machinegun fire filled its vantage point with a rolling cloud of dirt and dust.\n\nThe annihilating, sense-shattering explosions came soon after, and the Ghost increased its elevation.\n\nIt waited until long after the battle had died out, and the surviving Risen had all left, before lowering itself back to earth. It wasn't even sure which side had won. It didn't matter.\n\nThe day had turned to dusk.",

        "description": "The man opened his eyes and took an even breath. Almost nothing was where he remembered it. Eaton was gone. Blasted and paved. Mild climate was the only reason the shacks and huts that made up most of the town remained standing.\n\nBut the storm of Light versus Light had left scorched earth and shadows behind. And the bones of the dead. It was a blood red dusk. Ghost hovered above him.\n\nThe man looked down at his hands. He tried to chuckle, but coughed instead.\n\n\"Are you all right?\" Ghost asked.\n\nHe stood up, straighter than he had in a long time. Easier to seem like people when you slouch.\n\n\"Germaine?\" Ghost asked.\n\n\"That's not my name.\"\n\n\"You let them call you that.\"\n\nThe man turned to look at his Ghost. \"It's not my name. One 'a the Warlords mentioned seeing a lone Ghost. Did you get sloppy?\"\n\nGhost nodded. \"I'm sorry. I was scouting a new livestock route for you and I got carried away.\"\n\n\"I don't ask for much,\" said the man, shaking his head. \"Shovel. Get me one.\"\n\nGhost scanned the debris and ash to find a charred spade, lifting it with a lasso of Light.\n\nThe man slowly gathered all the bones he could find and began to dig.\n\n\"The child. Yu,\" Ghost continued.\n\n\"Stop talking,\" he replied.\n\n\"What did she tell you? You were speaking to her at the end.\"\n\nHe didn't respond. It would be lifetimes before he told Ghost the answer. But he would remember.\n\n\"You could have helped her.\"\n\nThe shovel hit the dirt harder. \"I told you to shut up.\"\n\n\"You could have saved them all.\"\n\nThe man had nothing to say.\n\nHe must have been making more noise than he thought, because just as he finished digging a grave big enough for the bones, a voice called out. He dropped the shovel, stared across the vacant town square at the smoldering ruin of the Diaz barn.\n\nEaton was dead. No point in keeping his secret any longer.\n\nHe crossed the distance at a speed and ease that would have shocked his neighbors and rounded a corner to find Judson, on the ground, leaning against the barn door. There was a cannon in Judson's hand, and his eyes opened wide when he recognized the man and his Ghost.\n\nJudson lifted the gun with a shaking fist. His other hand clutched a dark stain on his side.\n\n\"He's lost a lot of blood,\" Ghost said, its Light spilling across the scene.\n\n\"You were one 'a them all along,\" Judson sneered.\n\nThe man chuckled. \"All my lives, brother.\"\n\n\"You got us killed, you son of a—\"\n\nThe man kicked the firearm out of Judson's hand with no urgency at all. He knelt down to point a finger. \"No, no, that one's on you. Those Warlords caught you. What else were they gonna do? I wanted to stop you from leaving, but I didn't think I had the right.\"\n\nJudson reached out to grab his throat. The man caught his hand in a vice-grip instead, a crushing handshake. Judson frowned and struggled, but he was exhausted. Dying. And the man had strength that belied his frame.\n\nThe man lifted his other hand, smoldering from a Solar glow, and held it against Judson's wound. His former friend managed a high-pitched wail, but couldn't break the man's grip, though he tried and tried.\n\nThe man nodded at Judson, addressing his Ghost. \"Do you see how he never gives up? Because he knows this one life is all he has? No fear.\"\n\n\"Those Risen out there?\" The man finished cauterizing the wound and used his suddenly-cool hand to wave indiscriminately into the darkening night. \"They'd be long dead if they were him. All they know is war. This man survives.\"\n\nJudson made a gurgling sound. He had stopped struggling, but the man kept a grip on his hand.\n\n\"You wanted me to save him? Even if this works, he could never show me how to live. Not like he lives. And that's on you.\"\n\nGhost watched, but made minute adjustments to his orbiting armor and sent Light-based scans cascading across the ruins of town. If there were lingering Warlords or Iron Lords nearby, they would have to run.\n\nThe man stood up. Judson was dead.\n\n\"Maybe you should have told him you were bringing livestock in from a hundred leagues away and releasing them for him to catch,\" Ghost said.\n\n\"I mean—did you see how happy he was? How they all were? They got to eat,\" the man replied. \"Give someone something to chase and you give them purpose.\"\n\n\"You're pathetic. This is what you aspire to be? A perennial liar who plays house with refugees? These people are dead because of us!\"\n\n\"I lived here as one of them.\"\n\n\"You could be so much more. Let me show you how powerful your Light can become.\"\n\nThe man walked past his Ghost and brought Judson's corpse to the center of town. As he began digging again, he noticed the bloated, spherical husk that dominated the sky. It had been out of his life for a while, but it seemed a lot closer to earth tonight.\n\nHe raised a hand to salute it with a single finger, as Ghost looked on.\n\n\"How you livin'?\" he said, and gave a smile to the heavens that ended at his eyes.",

        "description": "\"I never forgive and I never forget. I live a hard life, sister.\" —A Dark Age drifter\n\n\nWu Ming's bar wasn't always bustling, but it was this afternoon. Wu served anyone who could pay, but his clientele were often Risen. Not because he provided a menu particularly suited to them, but because he had built his bar at the foot of a mountain called Felwinter Peak.\n\nFelwinter was a former Warlord—the only one, it was said, to hold an entire mountain all by himself. He now rode with the Iron Lords, and Felwinter Peak was staunchly the territory of the Iron Wolves. They had never given Wu permission to build the bar.\n\nHe had never asked.\n\nAlmost to a person, the patrons tonight were without Ghosts. High winds and inhospitable cold meant those without Ghosts rarely visited. But tonight, word had reached the general population that Warlords were back in the region. No shots had been fired. Not yet. But it was enough to get every poor, Lightless wretch from miles around into Wu's bar, where chances were an Iron Lord or Lady might be having a drink. Wu Ming didn't mind.\n\nThe door swung open again, and a trio of armored figures marched in from the cold. \"Welcome to the End of the World,\" greeted the serving frame. The Warlords shouldered past the 55-30 and headed straight for Wu Ming at the counter.\n\n\"What can I get you?\" Wu asked, giving a smile that ended at his eyes.\n\nThe leading Warlord, a hulking man with shoulder guards larger than his brain, grunted, \"Food. Everything you have.\" \n\nWu raised an eyebrow. \"Sure. That'll be... well, a lotta Glimmer.\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" the giant man said, grabbing Wu by the lapels of his stormcoat. \"Give us everything you have in the back, or we'll gut you and eat you alive.\"\n\n\"Hey Citan,\" a woman's voice said. \"Pick on someone your own size.\"\n\nAll eyes turned to a helmeted figure standing a few feet behind Citan. She only came up to the giant man's sternum.\n\n\"Lady Efrideet,\" Citan muttered.\n\nWu Ming's gaze went from the Iron Lady to the three Warlords positioned around the bar amongst his Lightless patrons. He cursed under his breath and braced to duck.",

Felwinter's lost his mind siding with you lot.\"\n\nUnderneath the helm, Citan's eyes flickered from the Iron Lady to his Warlord ally positioned behind her. The flanking Warlord raised a massive hand cannon and thundered a bullet—\n\nDirectly into Citan's chest as Efrideet dropped to a knee. She swung her cannon to her right side with her left fist and let loose with a roaring double-tap behind her, shattering the rear Warlord's head. Wu Ming saw that she hadn't so much as looked.\n\nThe third Warlord's submachine weapon fired a spray of bullets that hammered the floor as Efrideet rolled. Wu cursed inwardly as wood splinters went flying all over the room. People screamed.\n\nBut it was already over. The third Warlord crumpled. Efrideet's solar knife had divided his head.\n\n\"Hold!\" the Lady barked, firing her cannon into the ceiling as three Ghosts materialized above their charges. Bits of wood fell on her shoulder. Wu Ming cursed audibly this time.\n\n\"You know who I am,\" she shouted at the room. \"At this distance, I could shoot all of you out of the air swifter than you could ever bring your Risen back.\"\n\nThe Traveler's children froze, their shells spinning aggressively in the air like metallic bees.\n\n\"You're free to go,\" she told them. \"But your Risen stay with me. Follow the Iron Decree and you'll get them back. In time.\" The Ghosts looked at one another.\n\n\"Tell the Warlords,\" she sneered. \"Felwinter Peak belongs to the Wolves.\"\n\nThe Ghosts left the way their owners came. The bar patrons began murmuring.\n\nEfrideet's Ghost, always a quick thinker, started playing music: Lady Skorri singing an old hymn.\n\nThe patrons backed away from the three Warlord bodies, but began chattering amongst themselves. The din of conversation gradually filled the room and built to a dull roar. The music helped.\n\n\"Is this why you asked me here?\" Efrideet said, holstering her weapon. \"You said you had some business that paid.\"\n\n\"I did. You just finished it,\" he responded, reaching out with a fistful of Glimmer. The Iron Lady stared down at it, gawking beneath her helmet.\n\n\"Who the hell pays you?\"\n\n\"I have means,\" Wu Ming said, chuckling. \"Stick with me, sister. I'll make you rich. I promise.\"\n\nShe eagerly took the sapphire cubes out of his hand. Glimmer represented pure material potential.\n\n\"You didn't bring Felwinter,\" Wu said.\n\nShe eyed him. \"I told you he never comes down from the Peak unless it's official Iron Lord business. What do you need from him?\"\n\n\"Hey, what're you doing later?\" Wu asked suddenly.\n\n\"Hunting Fallen. They're becoming a problem at Boyle Pass. We'll be at it 'til dusk,\" Efrideet said, lifting the helmet just above her mouth to grab a drink from behind the counter and swallow an entire mug of the malt Wu served. She belched and asked, \"Care to join us?\" Her smile just beneath the helm was all teeth.\n\nWu chuckled. \"Nah, a mere mortal at a Risen fight? I'd just get in the way.\" He thought for a second. \"Would you like to dance before you go?\"\n\n\"Nah,\" she said, imitating his tone. The helm came down.\n\nHe cocked his head over the music, then leaned in to ask, \"Wait, what did you think I said?\"\n\n\"Would you like to dance before you go?\" she repeated.\n\n\"I would love to,\" he said, stepping forward, arms wide.\n\nShe side-stepped him and kicked his leg out from under him. He went tumbling to the ground, and someone spilled their drink on him.\n\n\"I had to try,\" he called from the floor, watching her go. The plume of her helmet rose above the crowd, and was already halfway out the door. \"Take the bodies!\" he yelled, still on the ground.\n\n**\n\nIt took him three hours to climb the Peak that night. He was shivering in his long coat, and if not for his Ghost, he would have succumbed to the cold long ago. Ghost was hidden, of course.\n\nThe massive castle doors were already open when he arrived at the top. An Exo, eyes glowing in its sleek black skull, stood just beyond them. It released whatever weapon it was reaching for inside its greatcoat when Wu Ming approached with his hands held high.\n\n\"I come in peace, brother.\"",

I live downstairs, been trying to get your attention for a month,\" Wu Ming grinned.\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\nWu thought about it. \"I heard you kill.\"\n\n\"A necessity of life in this post-Collapse existence.\"\n\n\"No, I'm talkin' Risen.

Wu had the feeling the Exo would sit, frozen in time, until he said something.\n\n\"Ghost,\" Wu Ming beckoned. His only friend in the world materialized out of the air.\n\n\"Is that supposed to impress me?\" Felwinter asked without a shred of irony. \"How else would you have survived the climb?\"\n\nWu coughed. Ghost shook its head at him.\n\n\"Let me ask again, then,\" Wu Ming said, straightening to his full posture in the stupid chair. \"Will you break the Iron Decree? Will you kill for real?\"\n\n\"As a Warlord, I did many things I'm not proud of. Under the Iron Lords, I adhere to strict rules of engagement,\" Felwinter said. His voice sounded hollow inside his armored skin. \"Ghosts are not valid targets.\"\n\n\"I heard you care very much about right and wrong, and the delivery of justice to those who deserve it.\"\n\nFelwinter's eyes glowed brighter.\n\n\"I can't think of a more human act,\" he said after a moment's pause.\n\n\"I don't know that anyone has a right to that. But I believe in revenge with all my heart. And I have a request, knowing that you do what you do.\"\n\nFelwinter tapped his chin. \"What are you asking me?\"\n\nWu Ming told him a story about a long-forgotten town far away called Eaton, early in the age of Iron Lords. A Lord called Dryden had brought food for the town's starving people, but in return, asked to use them as bait to bring a local Warlord into position for an ambush. This, Wu had learned, went against the code set out by Lord Radegast, the founder of the order. Dryden had broken the rule of involving Lightless individuals in Iron Lord business, because it was those people the Lords had unified to protect. The town had agreed, of course. What choice did it have? But the ambush had gone horribly wrong. The Warlord target had brought a whole fireteam to the fight. Eaton's erasure was utter and complete. Though Wu later learned that Dryden won the battle, he lost every Lord under his command, Ghosts and all, and he committed the additional sin of inflicting final deaths on the Warlords he defeated, in an act of bloodlust and rage. In the intervening years, Wu had learned that Dryden kept this under wraps, and that he and his Ghost were now among the most decorated of Lords, next to the likes of rising champions like Lord Saladin and Lady Efrideet themselves.\n\nFelwinter sat frozen in his chair. It was difficult to tell if he had registered any of what Wu Ming had said.\n\n\"How do I know you're not lying?\" the hollow voice asked finally.\n\n\"I have live recordings,\" Wu replied. His Ghost transmitted a data stream to Felwinter's Ghost, who nodded.\n\n\"Eaton. Who were those people to you?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Just ghosts.\"\n\n\"You want revenge for people you care nothing about?\"\n\n\"Is the Darkhorse of Iron for hire?\"\n\nFelwinter stood, and politely motioned for Wu Ming to take his leave.\n\nWu sighed, shrugged, and left the chamber. He had a long climb ahead of him.\n\nThe Exo parted his coat and drew a long, bronze shotgun from his side.\n\n\"What do you think?\" his Ghost asked.\n\n\"Call Lord Dryden. Prepare my Iron Banner arsenal.\"",

We didn't let him in, but we don't stop him, either.\"\n\nLavinia, as afraid of success as she is of failure, shivers through a thrill of nerves. \"Xûr,\" she corrects the Titan, then, feeling like a pedant: \"Sorry.

She will have to trust in that luck now.\n\nShe descends to the hangar floor and walks determinedly up to the thing. It does not even lift its hood to look. \"Xûr,\" she says, unsure what to do with her hands. \"I'm Cryptarch Lavinia Garcia Umr Tawil. I've chosen to study the Nine.\" As all fools do, her master told her. \"I want to ask you a question.\"\n\n\"You have no need of it.\" The voice hidden in that squirming face is a man's, low and incongruously clear.

She sees an almost human curiosity, but stretched over the rack of an alien shape, a provisional superstructure cobbled together to make a manlike form, ever on the verge of failure. \"Planets,\" it says. \"My motions, in large part, depend upon their configuration.\"\n\nShe doesn't shudder, much. \"My colleagues say the artifact came from the Vex, as a warning that they will exist wherever we go. But I think,\" she swallows, \"I think it's from the Nine. Did the box of dust come from the Nine, Xûr?\"\n\nXûr's golden eyes shine at her. \"I am here for a reason,\" he says. \"I cannot remember...the dust has changed. The dust is precious.\"\n\n\"Yes! Did the Nine send us the dust? Why is dust precious, Xûr?\" Why dust at all? Why not a letter, or a clay tablet, or anything clear?\n\n\"Blood,\" Xûr says, and makes a sound like a cough. \"The blood is transformed. The wish is granted. The dust is commingled.\"\n\n\"It can't be the Vex who sent it,\" she insists, as if Xûr is another stubborn Cryptarch who won't listen.\n\n(Lavinia you must stop babbling.) \"The Vex use matter as a substrate for computation, not a medium to communicate. How is it that the Nine can map the mass of every rocky planet in the galaxy, but not send us a message on the radio? Why Venus? Why dust?\"\n\n\"Much of dust was once cells,\" Xûr says, and coughs loudly. \"This dust was once of the Nine. It commingled. It was forever changed.\" That harsh, percussive cough again. \"Dust to dust. One dust to another. The Nine are the flesh of dust.\"\n\nLavinia realizes that the Agent of the Nine is laughing.",

ENOUGH!\" This new voice is strange to Lavinia but the power in it can only be Ikora Rey's. \"You will never touch a mortal human in anger again! That is not our purpose!\"\n\nThunder booms; something detonates nearby; Lavinia's ears pop. She gets the sense that, voluntarily or otherwise, the two New Monarchy Guardians have vanished.

A long chunk of jaw with one huge white protruding tooth. It's warm and comforting and solid. She clutches it protectively, the key, the eggtooth that will crack open the mystery of the Nine and put her back in her master's good graces and save her from the probation Rahool dropped on her when he hauled her out of the archives—\n\nWith an effort of will that makes her shout out loud, she opens her fist and drops the Ahamkara bone.\n\nIkora Rey makes it fly away. \"You weren't after that bone. It was after you. Did you make a wish, Lavinia? Did you ask to know about the Nine?\"\n\nShe tries to explain that she didn't, that she only wanted to track the bone back to its source (Venus, hopefully), and to learn why the Nine needed the Ahamkara.\n\n\"Why do you think the Nine needed Ahamkara?\" Ikora asks, dangerously.\n\n\"To make wishes,\" Lavinia pants. \"Xûr didn't appear in the Tower until the end of the Great Ahamkara Hunt. Whatever they used to get from the Ahamkara...\"\n\nShe leaves it unsaid: maybe the Nine are now getting it from Guardians.\n\nIkora rubs her brow. \"I can't stop you. But if you keep looking, I can't protect you from the consequences.\"\n\n\"Help me!\" Lavinia begs. \"There's something here! Something that connects everything, the Trials, and the Ahamkara, and the Guardians, and the Nine. There are things the Consensus knows about Ghaul's attack, things they haven't told us—\"\n\nIkora Rey puts up one finger. Lavinia shuts up. \"Choose. Are you going to go back to school, and let me pretend you were never here? Or do I have to report you for theft of an Ahamkara bone?\"\n\nLavinia takes a deep breath. \"I'm sorry,\" she says. \"I have to keep going.

Endless revels light up the purple sky; people leap off the world and drift away into the artificial atmosphere, to be collected, protesting woozily, by the skiffload.\n\nLavinia is a wallflower here, forever on the edge of things. She gets pangs of homesickness every night, and tells herself that the Reef is the right place to begin her journey home. This meeting, right now, might be the first step...\n\n\"Much mourning,\" the Fallen at her side murmurs. \"Master Ives murdered, Variks missing. Spider hires away my friends. Well, I stay to guard Master Ives's work. You come in, make yourself into a home. I will bring nitrogen tea and records.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" Lavinia wants to laugh, or maybe cry, at the malapropism. If only she could make herself into a home! But it'll be all right in the end. She will find the Nine, bring the truth home, and earn forgiveness.\n\nThe Fallen returns with tea and devices. \"Watch. Record from Prison of Elders. Master Ives fascinated by it.\"\n\nShe sees Skolas, fallen Kell of Fallen Kells, waiting to die by combat. His huge horned armor lags his motions, like a weary companion trying to mimic everything he does. A servitor pumps ether into him. Lavinia wonders what would happen if she took Ether. Would she feel clearly and coldly determined? Would she turn into a huge Lavinia? Would she stop missing her home?\n\n\"Mara.\" Skolas's mouth was not made for that name. \"Mara, do you hear?\"\n\n\"The Queen of the Reef sentenced him to the fate of all Fallen,\" Lavinia's companion sighs. \"To strive, and struggle, and fail. But he was already lost. His mind broke at the Citadel, where he saw into time.\"\n\nSkolas blows white vapor. Frost crackles on his mask. \"You gifted me to the Nine. And they sent me back. People think you are a fool. That you made an error releasing me. Led your people to die on my blade, as I led my people to die on yours.\"\n\nLavinia's translator murmurs along with the Kell's words. \"The Nine's agent never told me why he released me. Now I know. You know also, I think. Both of you require the Guardians... and the Nine do not understand life and death. So they sent me back to you, to make the Guardians come. They did not comprehend the harm.\n\n\"I do not comprehend them either. I traveled among the Jovians for years, in their dominion. But I do not know the Nine. You, Mara Sov... you are the only one who bargains with them. You are the only one who has foreseen their role in the game. You keep your successes secret, so the world only knows your mistakes. No wonder I underestimated you.\"\n\nHe hefts the scorch cannon his jailers have given him. Lavinia thinks of the tools his House once favored: shuttle and loom. \"I saw the shape of the Nine on Venus. A place that was once precious to them, where wishes could transfigure their flesh. I saw that they are bound to this star and to these worlds. You are of a kind in that way, you and the Nine. Not I. I will be glad to leave this world, Mara Sov. I am tired of being a pawn.\"\n\nSkolas lays his huge horned head back against the cell wall.\n\nLavinia, watching, spills her tea in excitement. \"They want to help us,\" she whispers. \"They're from our planets! They want to help! Oh, I'm sorry, I'm so clumsy—\"\n\nShe leans down to mop up the spilled tea. A flashbang grenade detonates in her face. The next thing she knows an Awoken officer is sentencing her, under martial law, to life in prison for espionage.\n\nLavinia, fumbling for any sign of her good luck, is glad to see the Fallen go free.",

Either she is subvocalizing in code, or chewing her tongue off before she insults Paladin Kamala Rior's honored guest.\n\n\"Three minutes to closest approach,\" the flight dynamics officer calls. \"INCO, target emissions status?\"\n\n\"The Leviathan is illuminating us with targeting sensors. No change.\"\n\nPaladin Rior pulls Lavinia out of her nook. \"Miss Umr Tawil, please come observe the instruments with me.\"\n\n\"Do you do this a lot?\" Lavinia wants to impress Paladin Rior, who sprung her from jail because, in her words, \"every brain in the Reef is busy thinking about one problem, so I need your brain for another.\" Lavinia doesn't want to let her down. \"Step on the tiger's tail with these... fly-bys?\"\n\n\"Shows of force,\" Kamala corrects her. \"We need Calus to believe that we're prepared to meet his ship with our own fleet. And if we can investigate other mysteries along the way, like your theory about the Nine, then all the better. Here, now. This is the device you requested. Please observe.\"\n\nKamala shows her a pane of black glass, illuminated by a faint purple fuzz that sweeps left to right. Lavinia touches it in awe. \"That's dark matter?\"\n\n\"Correct.\" Every schoolchild knows that most mass in the universe is dark matter; but it is nothing more than mass, and it never forms structures smaller than a galactic halo. Dark matter has no charge, passes through itself, never gathers into clumps, and has no chemistry. It is only ever dust.\n\n\"If you're right...\" Kamala draws in a breath. \"Any moment...\"\n\n\"Drive field error!\" the flight officer calls. \"Minor perturbation on the leading edge. We are encountering unexpected mass groups. No corresponding radar or lidar contacts.\"\n\nThe black screen of the dark matter detector explodes into frenzied purple-white shapes, like the webs of a spider locked in sensory deprivation for a million billion years. Thick cords of shadowstuff that twine into strangling arms which branch again into thousands of tiny fingers that pierce—\n\n—straight through the Cabal Leviathan.\n\n\"Oh my,\" Lavinia breathes. \"That's the dark matter we're passing through?\"\n\n\"Correct.\"\n\n\"And this is unusual? This level of structure?\"\n\n\"Miss Tawil,\" Kamala says, \"a single molecule of dark matter would be unusual. This is blasphemous excess. This is impossibility.\"\n\nNo, Lavinia thinks. This is the Nine. They're looking at Calus. They're reaching out. These are their hands...\n\n\"We should've thought to use this sensor earlier,\" Kamala muses. \"Our Queen invented it to assist navigation when we were losing ships near Rhea. A phaeton backscatter scan. Very clever. Everything she did seems to make sense, eventually; she was so very far-sighted. No one else ever bargained with the Nine as an equal, did they? No one will ever know what good she did for them... our Queen of secrets.\"\n\n\"I have to contact the City!\" Lavinia fumbles for some way to get a capture of the screen, a picture of the Nine, but she doesn't have her tablet. \"I found them!\"\n\n\"Ah. About that.\" Rior's armored hand falls on her shoulder. \"The Queen's edict also forbids me from disclosing the Reef's knowledge of the Nine to individuals without REGAL clearance. So. Thank you for your assistance, Miss Tawil. Take her back to her cell.\"\n\nIf anyone ever calls her Lucky Lavinia again, she thinks she might shoot them.",

She's trapped in Cocytus! The last time the Awoken trapped anyone here, those poor souls went utterly insane. The doomed crew of the Dead Orbit scout ship Sophia called this place A113, an innocent catalogue number; they had no idea that the gates aboard—once a Golden Age experiment—had been captured by the Hive deity Crota. Those gates consumed them all.\n\nNow Crota is gone, and Lavinia has gambled everything that the portals have fallen into other hands. Ahamkara make the unreal real—Calus's ship is surrounded by a halo of unreal dark matter, like a ring of probing hands, Guardians can manipulate reality itself—there is a pattern here, a story, and it leads to Cocytus, to what these gates might do.\n\n\"Logs.\" She pages frantically through the observations left by the Awoken sentries once stationed here. Cocytus was abandoned when the Red Legion attacked, all its defenses scavenged to reinforce Vesta. \"What came out of the gate? What did you see?\"\n\n//EVENT 1 TIME 00:00:00 Portal 3 emitted a hydrogen nucleus. Over 72 hours, the emissions developed from diatomic hydrogen to nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, water, and simple organic molecules. At the 80-hour mark, a pellet of thick black hydrocarbon tar. Until 82:34:15, the gate emitted tar containing complex monomers and polymers—\n\n\"Come on!\" Lavinia barks, paging ahead. \"Come on, damn you, give me something real! Give me the Nine!\"\n\n//EVENT 1 TIME 524:03:11 Portal 3 emitted a living organism. Death was immediate. Autopsy team reports a spherical body, radius one point one meters, surfaced in hydrocarbon tar. Deep, evenly spaced \"throats\" converged on a central cavity perhaps intended to serve as lung and stomach. The body consists of an undifferentiated tissue of primitive cells. A basic spasm reflex forces air down the throats. Without enzymes to catalyze metabolism, the organism could not survive. Cell death occurred instantaneously throughout the mass. There were no provisions for self-repair or reproduction.\n\nLavinia reads this again, horrified and fascinated. Something on the far side of the gate is learning to assemble atoms, molecules, even haphazard life... something from a world of darkness and dust, probing its way into our structured existence, trying to cobble together a message, an emissary, a body...\n\nThe Nine are on the far side of this gate. She's sure of it. She's found them.\n\nBut to meet the Nine directly... would that be madness? Would there be any return? Would she ever see the City again?\n\nShe's come so far for her truth.\n\nAn alarm sounds in her helmet. INCOMING TRANSMAT, the suit warns her. INCOMING TRANSMAT. Her radio barks at her, stern as Ikora Rey: \"Cryptarch Lavinia Garcia Umr Tawil.\" It's Paladin Rior. \"You stand in violation of the Queen's law. Surrender yourself, and you will be treated fairly.\"\n\nLavinia stares into the yawning gate. Beyond it lies a realm of utter darkness and dissolution, a place where nothing exists except the most alien forms. To go there would be suicide. She would die like the poor tarball creature.\n\nBut what lies behind her? Failure? Surrender? Shame? A life in a cell?\n\n\"Lucky Lavinia,\" she says, and leaps through.",

It is the hardest thing in the universe for the dust to make a loop at all, because, like a gust of wind or a river, it was only meant to move one way. For a mind to function, the end of one thought must alter the beginning of the next: so, like rivers, like wind, the Nine could not have minds until they could make loops.\n\nLavinia Garcia Umr Tawil comprehends the Nine.\n\nThey were already ancient when the first human beings named themselves. Their flesh was older than stars: the dark dust wind that blows through the galaxy, pinched by the gravity of Sol and its planets, drawn into their cores and exhaled again.\n\nThese were the Nine.\n\nIn time loops did form. Great arcs of outbound dust collapsed back to their sources to create circuits of shadow. The thickening and thinning of these circuits were the first thoughts of the Nine. They dwelt in massive indifference, unborn primordial gods. There was no force among them except gravity; no structure except the distribution of mass. Their hearts were in the cores of worlds, but their farthest streams faded out into the turn of the galaxy.\n\nThey were the fountains of Achlys, the night before chaos.\n\nBut life arose on the worlds at the heart of the Nine, tiny complicated motions of ecosystems and metabolisms and computations. That life left mass-shadows in the wind of the Nine, plucking at them like harp strings. From these trembles of structure the Nine learned to seed enormous resonating waves, thoughts vaster than worlds.\n\nSo the Nine awoke. And in time they understood that they were as fragile as they were mighty; for if the life that seeded their thoughts ever passed away, they too would vanish.\n\nThey had no eyes to catch light. They had no ears to hear. And yet they turned their wills upon the alien world of Matter, and strove to learn, for they knew they had to protect their hearts, or die.\n\nWith a horror of revelation so absolute that it would drive her mad if she still had sanity to lose, Lavinia understands where the Nine have always been. They are within everyone, every system, every living and moving thing. Trillions and pentillions of slim dark matter tentacles plunged through all our bodies, drinking up the complexity of our lives and thoughts.\n\nWe are all pinched silhouettes impaled on the twitchings of infinitely long spiderlegs.",

Lavinia perceives, without emotion, that she now exists as a structure of dark dust, a sandstorm blowing against itself.\n\n\"Come,\" the voice calls. \"I am Nasya. You are not safe. Come with me.\"\n\nNot safe?\n\nNo. Of course she is not safe. Because there are factions among the Nine: one faction sent Xûr and Orin to study Guardians and the Light, to seek the secret of effect-without-cause and to protect the source of that secret, the last source, now that the Ahamkara are gone. Those five played at alchemy with the Cocytus gates, turning dark dust into energy and then into matter, but they could not unlock the secrets of our mad existence. They needed ambassadors. Go-betweens.\n\nThe other faction walks a different path. A path of folds and needles slipped through spacetime itself, existential syringes yielding new spaces, to be remade as the Nine desire. They have tried to gather enough dark dust in one place to form a black hole, and found it difficult: when the dark mass collapses in gravity's fist, the dust passes through itself and scatters.\n\nBut difficult is not impossible. And there is far, far more dark matter in the universe than bright. They will find a way to make new worlds of it. They will end their dependence on life, and on the Light of Guardians, which the falling veil will soon snuff out forever...\n\nIn passing, Lavinia sees the entire history of the Queen's interactions with the Nine: more than anyone suspected, and more vital. She sees how one of the Nine blinded Guardians to Ghaul's approach, risking everything (for Ghaul would have destroyed the sun, and the Nine with it) to learn how to steal the Light. She sees how that one was punished.\n\n\"Come!\" Nasya calls, urgently. \"Come with me! Come quickly, before—\"\n\nSomething dark and hypodermic pierces the void beneath Lavinia and slurps her down, pulls her through a proboscis so tiny that it breaks her apart into a stream of single particles, one after another. She is annihilated...\n\n... and reborn, somewhere, somewhen, made of flesh again, shaking and dripping fear-sweat, mewling like a little baby. Her cheek presses against a warm wooden floor. There's a fireplace, and a fire in it, and strong wind outside that sucks at the flames.\n\nThe clever-looking old lady at the desk looks up. \"Ah,\" she says. \"Lavinia! You made it.\"\n\n\"Wh—\" Lavinia gasps. \"Wha—\"\n\nShe smiles, as if Lavinia's confusion is the sweetest greeting she's ever heard. \"Don't be afraid. You've come to exactly the right place.\"\n\n\"Where...?\"\n\n\"Someplace where you're appreciated. Where we can really use everything you've learned.\" The old lady pours a thin stream of tea into a cup of bone. \"Didn't I tell you that you were lucky, back when you were born?\"",

Fallen armed forces continue to fall back from active fronts across Terra. Factions of House Dusk remain active in the European Dead Zone. Throughout the rest of the globe, refugee attack incidents have dropped by more than 70% since the conclusion of the Red War—largely attributable to depressed Fallen and human populations rather than any significant change in interspecies relations.\n\n2. In absence of any united leadership, House Dusk continues to splinter and radicalize.\n\nThe recent trending emergence of so-called \"crime syndicates\" (cf. report #004-FALLEN-SIV) is emblematic of the continuing destructuralization of Fallen society. Likely an artifact of multi-generational colonization of human strongholds, this agent believes that because these syndicates have no relation to indigenous Fallen culture, young Fallen are appropriating and imitating human mythology in absence of a strong cultural heritage of their own.\n\nMuch like the dissolution of the Kell/Archon theology, this is positive news for those interested in the complete extirpation of invasive Fallen from the system.\n\n3. That being said, we should continue to monitor reunification efforts. Several personalities have emerged as potential leaders. First, the would-be integrationists:\n\nVIP #1121, well-known to Guardians of the inner system as Variks, or Variks the Loyal. Directly responsible for the release of the murderer Uldren Sov from the Prison of Elders, #1121 subsequently fled Awoken holdings in the Reef and now styles himself the Kell of Kells, still representing House Judgement. The Praxic Order has petitioned the Vanguard for permission to detain #1121. The Awoken monarchy, acting through the Queen's Wrath, has claimed jurisdiction over #1121 and further stated that any prosecution in absence of their involvement will be considered an act of war. The Vanguard has not yet made a statement about their position on the issue.\n\nVIP #3987, another former confederate of the Awoken, is a lesser-known personality known as Mithrax. Scattered field reports suggest that like #1121, #3987 styles himself a Kell of the so-called \"House Light,\" an otherwise unknown House apparently founded by #3987 himself. We have secondhand accounts that Mithrax has engaged in allied operations with Guardians in the field, though we have not as yet been able to corroborate these accounts with any degree of veracity. This agent is inclined to treat these reports with a healthy degree of skepticism until otherwise confirmed, as they may be propaganda from Fallen sympathizers in the Old Russian and Red War Guardian cohorts. We have requested intelligence records from the Awoken which may further clarify the matter.\n\nIn addition, whatever the findings of said intelligence records may be, it should be stressed that one or two sympathetic outliers cannot be relied upon to erase the wrongs of past centuries, nor should their good-faith efforts to correct the sins of their forebears be taken as sufficient symbolic reparation.\n\nSecond, the would-be separatists:\n\nVIP #4503, a recent personality known as Fikrul, or the Fanatic. A close confederate of the murderer Uldren Sov, #4503 has the apparent ability to raise himself from the dead in a manner not dissimilar to Ghost-aided resurrection. Though his reign on the Tangled Shore was limited, he possesses sufficient skill, hatred, and motive to warrant on-going surveillance. Given #4503's propensity for resurrection, the inherent risk of #4503 reclaiming the body of the murderer Uldren Sov from his final resting place in the Dreaming City goes without saying. The Vanguard continues to deploy fireteams to suppress #4503; our agents have reached out to the Cryptarchy and the Gensym Scribes to request guidance as to his permanent destruction.\n\nVIP #2029, a once-known personality known as Eramis, or Eramis, the Shipstealer. A House Devils Baroness incarcerated during the Wolf Wars, #2029 successfully fled the Prison of Elders during the mass escape orchestrated by #1121. #2029 is a classical Fallen pirate of the old ways: vicious, uncompromising, and possessing cunning of the highest degree. Field reports indicate that she is rallying violent dissidents to reconstruct House Devils from the ground up. This agent believes her to be the most viable candidate for universal Fallen reunification, and would urge the Vanguard and other interested leadership to aggressively prioritize her destruction.\n\nWe have come too far to pull our punches now.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS",

Following the events of the Red War and the recent loss of the Hunter Vanguard, current acting Vanguard leadership has struggled to define its function and role within what is an otherwise largely egalitarian and self-governing body of active Guardians. Much like the current popular perception of the Awoken queen, we have failed to adequately respond to questions about our integrity, competence, and unity as we have grieved the loss of the Hunter Vanguard.\n\nThe Vanguard was never intended as a governing body of authoritarians, nor does it function as such, but in times of turmoil and uncertainty, people rightly look to figures of strength for guidance and support. Neither the Titan Vanguard nor I ever intended to become politicians. We are warriors, first and foremost, and we no longer feel that we are able to serve as such.\n\nIn the spirit of honest self-reflection in the face of justified skepticism, we have begun to discuss the possibility of stepping down to invite new leadership into our place, as well as the general merits of disbanding the Vanguard entirely—largely because we believe that this crisis of identity will plague anyone who steps into this role. We recognize that this is ill-timed, and we will endeavor to involve the Consensus, the Guardians themselves, and all other interested parties in the discussion as appropriate. I specifically invite the Hidden to closely monitor the situation without my involvement. Should you agree that we are doing more harm than good, please do not hesitate to take whatever actions you agree are necessary.\n\n2. Regarding the open Hunter Vanguard position and the terms of Cayde's Dare: The situation is unprecedented. Were we to trace the chain of culpability back to its first link, I believe we would be obligated to elect a Hive god to our council.\n\nOur current inclination is to caucus with the Hunters to debate the benefits of opening the position to any interested and well-qualified Hunter. Such a debate is, of course, contingent upon the continued existence of the Vanguard itself. We will make an effort to convene the Hunters as soon as possible, but this group should be well aware that most credible candidates have fled the Tower in anticipation of such a debate.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS",

We are maintaining our containment posture at Cocytus. I assess no immediate danger to the system, and we have enough firepower to destroy the station and its mechanisms remotely if the on-site warheads fail. The station remains in the stable heliocentric orbit where it was parked after the destruction of Ceres.\n\n2. I do not ask confirmation of these theories, and in fact I beg you not to address them. But I have reviewed the site records, and the fate of the Sophia's crew after they were herded to Cocytus stinks of Hive madness. The Cocytus apertures must—at the time—have opened into a Hive manifold associated with Crota. Whatever their original purpose, when Crota established his presence in the system, they became conduits into hell... and the Sophia crew's ugly end proved it. Whoever drove the Sophia to its doom then installed the Cocytus Instruments around the original Golden Age facility to study Crota's manifold.\n\n3. Crota is dead. His hold on these gates has passed. Now something else is trying to pass through into our world... but it is so alien, and its sendings so bafflingly malformed, that I fear this can only end in madness.\n\n4. The first \"visitors\" through the third gate, at event time 00:00:00, were simple hydrogen atoms. Over the course of 72 hours, the emissions developed from diatomic hydrogen to nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, water, and simple organic molecules. At the 80-hour mark, we received our first macroscopic visitor, a pellet of thick black hydrocarbon tar. Until 82:34:15 the gate vomited tar containing increasingly complex monomers and polymers.\n\n5. The visitors then began to assume geometric form. A hail of cubes and hexagons, each built from molecular crystal of the same form as the whole. A series of fractal shapes that shattered under internal flaws. Several capsules or membranes of increasingly complex structure, containing water or oil. These may have been cellular precursors.\n\n6. At 524:03:11 a living organism appeared. Death was immediate. Remote dissection describes a spherical body, radius approximately one meter, surfaced in thick hydrocarbon tar. Deep, evenly spaced \"throats\" converged on a central cavity perhaps intended to serve as lung and stomach. The body exhibited undifferentiated tissue of primitive plantlike cells, capable of spasming to pump air or fluid in and out of the throats. Without enzymes to catalyze metabolism, or internal structure to dispose of waste, the organism could not survive. Cell death occurred almost instantaneously throughout the mass. There were no provisions for self-repair or reproduction.\n\n7. At 690:29:54 the gate emitted a tubular organism. For ninety seconds the organism moved across the gate chamber by contracting and expanding, then expired. Remote dissection describes a two-meter-long body with a spinal cavity full of energy-rich carbohydrate fluid. The organism's contractions forced this fluid through a capillary network, where simple cells catabolized the carbohydrates into energy to power further contractions. The buildup of heat and waste quickly denatured the enzymes required for metabolism, and the organism died. There were no provisions for self-repair or reproduction.\n\n8. The gate has remained inactive since, barring short emissions of molecules which may be experimental proteins. Remote drones have registered similar ambient molecules within the Hellmouth on Luna, though we have been unable to identify their source. We will maintain the quarantine until otherwise instructed.\n\nThe overwhelming impression I have is one of learning, of increasing sophistication in the synthesis and arrangement of matter. The atoms in these structures were isotopically pure and impossible to date, but I have the uncomfortable sense that even they were freshly made.\n\n9. Probes and instruments dispatched through the third gate do not return. Annihilation is apparently immediate, and so total that it seems to result from a fundamental failure of the ability to exist rather than any weapon or countermeasure. Yet something does exist on the far side, and it is trying to learn the rules of our world from very first principles. I do not eagerly anticipate its next creation.\n\nSENSITIVE!! – CONTENTS ABOVE SNIFFED FROM REEF DATACOMS – SENSITIVE!!\n\nCf. reports #3209-3211-LUNA-HEL\n\nMESSAGE ENDS",

Everybody's favorite conspiracy theorist is publishing again. Here's an excerpt from his latest paper—incomplete, I'm afraid, but you try for hi-def OCR at 500m during a rainstorm and tell me how you do.\n\n2. ...remain major unanswered questions about the failure of the City's information, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) network to detect the approaching Red Legion fleet.\n\nIt is by now well accepted that the Red Legion's sophistication in military affairs vastly exceeded our own. Although Ghaul's campaign made no real provision for continued resistance after the Traveler was contained and the Almighty moved into firing position, his opening gambit achieved a level of strategic surprise that would be the envy of any ancient general. Psion electronic warfare units compromised the City's sensor perimeters and suppressed our satellite early warning systems (so thoroughly that they even maintained their failsafe signals until the last possible moment). An extraordinary deception program in the Prison of Elders, combined with relativistic projectile strikes against key sensors, blinded the Reef to a simultaneous attack.\n\nBut how did the Red Legion escape the notice of the entire scattered Dead Orbit fleet? It would be politically unwise to suggest that the Arachs withheld information so their precious ships would be spared a losing battle... and indeed, the integrity of that same fleet proved invaluable in the counterattack and the city's reconstruction. It would be even more politically incendiary to suggest that the Future War Cult viewed the City's brief occupation as politically useful (or, more charitably, as a necessary step towards some desirable future timeline).\n\nBut it is impossible not to ask: how did the same Guardians who foresaw Oryx in prophecy (and in captured enemy material) fail to anticipate and take measures against the Red Legion attack? Is there something intrinsically more secular, and thus unforeseeable, about the Cabal? Do they practice superior information security to the Hive—unlikely, given the interception of a Cabal distress signal in the wake of the Taken War?\n\nDid some agency, henceforth unknown, act to conceal Ghaul's approach from our protectors? One that shared with Ghaul some central motive—whether the destruction of the Guardians, the capture of the Traveler, or the apprehension by force of the abilities we call the Light?\n\nIf such an agency exists, capable of such totality and subtlety in its action, how has it concealed itself from us?\n\n3. If I didn't know better, I'd say we had a leak. Hassan's a real ringer. Hope he gets rezzed as one of us when he dies.\n\n4. With all the usual regret, I'm going to forward a recommendation to the Cryptarchs to continue rejecting his submissions from legitimate publications. If anyone disagrees, just give a shout.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS",

As you all know, an unknown sender delivered six messages to VIP #2014. These missives were sent via Glimmer, using a simple encryption scheme that even a 55-30 unit Frame could have easily cracked. #2014's Ghost took immediate notice of these messages and quietly forwarded them on to IKO-006, who then distributed them back to us. Cf. reports #167-173-VESTA-DC for full transcripts.\n\n2. In these messages, the sender briefly purports to be none other than one ERI-223, providing fanciful details regarding her origins as a human woman who grew up in an apparent settlement of Old Russia known as St. Petersburg. None of this account sat well with anyone who actually knows ERI-223—not simply because none of her close confederates had any firsthand knowledge or belief that she knew of her pre-Guardian origins, but also because she is still active in the field and has personally denied sending these messages. That being said, in accordance with our rigor for skeptical inquiry, this agent was dispatched in pursuit of hard evidence to the contrary.\n\n3. I submit to you now photographic and video evidence recovered from civilian family albums, historical archives, and extant Ghost recordings originally captured in the Last City. Behold, ERI-223: a child of the Last City, born to civilian parents in a mortal-Guardian integrated neighborhood. Behold, too, tiny VIP #1786—though he is almost more unbelievable than ERI-223, if you look at his smile.\n\nOf the photos, original digital files are unavailable, but radiocarbon dating clearly identifies the earliest prints as more than three hundred years old. This is consistent with the timestamps of footage provided by volunteer Ghosts who were present during the same period. As to whether the child we believe to be ERI-223 is indeed ERI-223, please see the second compressed folder attached to this report for full double-blind forensics.\n\n4. In regards to the other personality presented in the six messages: Having consulted with AI-COM/RSPN and AI-COM/XBLK, both have attested that they have no record of any so-called craftmind designated Medusa. This does not discount the possibility that such a craftmind may have existed, but in light of the fact that someone was impersonating our former colleague, it follows that someone may have credibly invented a craftmind as well. We will continue to scour our records for any evidence to the contrary.\n\n5. Like many of those reading, this agent has a strong recommendation about the identity of the sender, but it is beyond the scope of this report. Cf. reports #024-VESTA-DC, 025-VESTA-DC, #026-VESTA-DC, #086-VESTA-DC, #001-034-HIVE-SAV, and #001-005-HIVE-DUL.\n\n6. Given the importance of #2014's contributions to our defense efforts as well as the recent downfall of the Awoken prince, this agent is deeply troubled by the idea that a malicious entity might seek to sway or confuse #2014 through the context of trusted allies. #2014's Ghost made brief mention of some kind of waking hallucination in one of its messages. Have we reached out to corroborate that report or provide additional counsel?\n\nMESSAGE ENDS",

Live-fire training exercises continue at the active incursion site on the Leviathan. No further RAID class operations have been documented since the unauthorized intervention against VIP #4044 at the explicit invitation of VIP #3801. This agent still believes that the Vanguard should institute stronger measures to prevent rogue teams from carelessly rushing to the aid of enemy VIPs – particularly given #3801's documented history of solicitous behavior and the tendency of our warriors to rush slack-jawed toward free gifts. #4044 could have been a useful catspaw in the destruction of #3801. We should not have intervened.\n\n2. Related to the above, #3801's aggressive propaganda campaign appears to have been successful. Despite #3801's recent inactivity, sentiment polls captured in the Tower at regular intervals over the last several months indicate that he has successfully swayed a significant percentage of the Red War cohort to believe that he may be a potential ally. Given our history with the Cabal as well as the events of the Red War itself, this is shocking and perhaps attributable to a case of mass traumatic bonding.\n\nIt is my strong recommendation that the Vanguard pursue a reeducation curriculum before #3801 invites any Guardians of the City to defect to his service, a possibility which we have documented in multiple previous reports.\n\n3. Nessus continues to remain stable, likely due to Vex machinoforming.\n\n4. The Awoken armada continues regular shows of force. The Leviathan remains non-hostile.\n\n5. Our agents continue to closely monitor inbound and outbound traffic to and from the Leviathan. As yet, we have not been able to observe any non-Guardian transport, providing additional evidence for the fact that the ship is either a self-contained ecosystem which has no paracausal exits or that it possesses some kind of internal stargate network by which occupants may invisibly enter and exit. As the Cabal have no documented history of such stargates, we are inclined to believe the former.\n\n6. In summary, there is no real news. However, this agent is inclined to regard this conspicuous passivity with suspicion rather than relief, and would urge Vanguard leadership to consider exploratory excursions in coming months.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS",

Last week, I was deployed by IKO-006 for routine surveillance of the quarantined zone outside the Hellmouth. Hive populations remain low and grow ever lower thanks to the efforts of a small contingent of veteran Guardians who have made their homes on Luna.\n\n2. Around 1900 hours yesterday afternoon, I began to experience a crushing headache and excused myself from patrol to recuperate. Though I originally intended to lay down for a nap, I fell asleep instead, and experienced multiple vivid dreams over the next 11.5 hours. In all of these dreams, I was trying to catch up with agent ERI-223 in a crowd. She was always out of reach, whether by 200 m or 20 m. I had the sense that I needed to speak to her.\n\n3. When I woke, I found that my headache had not improved. I prepared my armor and exited my bivouac to find a single stationary Thrall crouched nearby. It stood as I approached, but made no motion to attack me. I fired one shot, killing it immediately. Upon stepping forward to examine its corpse, I saw a solid black fragment of an unknown material embedded in its chest cavity. The fragment resembled a flake or a shard of some larger object, not dissimilar to a high-gain photovoltaic panel.\n\n4. I requested that my Ghost perform a standard material analysis of the fragment but neither one of us could confidently identify its qualities or provenance; that analysis is attached to this report as Analysis #1.\n\n5. I requested that my Ghost attempt to contain and transmat the fragment for quarantine on my jumpship. He was unable to establish a Light link with the object, describing the fragment as \"slippery\" and \"tiring\" to try to catch hold of.\n\n6. I used the barrel of my sniper rifle to touch and then work the fragment out of the Thrall's corpse. Using my rifle, I turned the fragment over and examined it from multiple angles. I requested that my Ghost run another deep scan of the object; that analysis is attached to this report as Analysis #2.\n\n7. We concluded that the material seemed to be inert and that it did not seem to be part of any complex device or mechanism.\n\n8. At this point, I broke protocol and did not request additional backup. Instead, I picked up the fragment by hand and immediately experienced a vivid hallucination: I stood over VIP #0704's  shoulder as she dressed a seven-inch gash on agent ERI-223's thigh. Both #0704 and ERI-223 were dressed for combat. Hundreds of fragments of the unknown material hung in the air around us, apparent shrapnel from the wreckage of a nearby ship of unrecognizable make and model. ERI-223 looked directly toward me and said, \"Патетическая.\"\n\n9. The duration of the hallucination was approximately seven seconds. At its conclusion, my headache disappeared. My Ghost and I held our position for the next thirty minutes, then collected the body of the Thrall and the fragment for transportation. I delivered myself and my cargo to quarantine and experienced no further mental disturbances while detained.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS",

To be clear, this was the Vanguard's proposal, not his. Despite the many skeptics who have good questions about the social risk inherent in providing #1315 with a more legitimate space, we feel that any disruption of morale or Tower culture will be short-term and minimal.

It is my belief that his presence will do more good than ill, and that the Tower has long stunted its own growth through narrow-minded fear and reactive exile of dissidents. We should endeavor to remain sharp skeptics of philosophies which differ from our own, but we should always be willing to hear and consider these philosophies.\n\nFurther: any concerned members of the Praxic Order should recall that the Vanguard holds jurisdiction over their actions, and that the exile of dissident philosophers is very different from the exile of rogue operators.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS",

THIS DATA OBTAINED FROM SURVEILLANCE DEVICES AT 1315-HOME2.\n\n2. In previous reports, I stated that it was my belief that #1315 had invoked some kind of paracausal event enabling the resurrection and return of enemy VIP #2015. This belief was predicated upon reports of creatures resembling the infamous \"Echoes of Oryx\" that Guardian forces engaged and destroyed en masse during the Taken War (cf. Ghost-stream footage here: CATHEDRAL.OF.DUSK.DREADNAUGHT).\n\nThis has proven false. Spectral analysis from multiple Ghosts participating undercover in Prime and Reckoning confirms that the impossible world at the heart of \"the haul\" is located in unknown space. (Cf. REP #001-012-PARAC-NINE.) Further, these Primevals differ in their literal elemental composition: low SNC, high ambient ΛCDM. #1315 has harnessed his \"banks\" to what appears to be an engine of pure potential. He no longer needs to pilfer the Ascendant Plane of Primevals, the oldest Taken in residence. He can create Primeval-likes from the energy of \"the haul\" and sheer force of will. As to the apparent presence of #2015, it is a falsehood. My handlers in the Praxic Order surmise simply: the shape of Oryx was the scariest Hive he could think of. He's tenacious, but he has a small mind.\n\n3. Highly recommend we assess #1315 for the influence of paracausal forces or entities. Since the conclusion of the joint Vanguard/Praxic investigation into his operations, the subject has become increasingly erratic. Beyond running his Gambit and Reckoning drills with the Guardian population, he has done nothing but hole up in the Annex. He has always exhibited the signs of stress related to prolonged solitude that are typical of all surviving Risen; this manifests in the subject in prolonged and rambling conversations with either himself or his as-yet-unseen Ghost. However, his musings have become less and less coherent over time. Late into the night, away from the Guardian cohorts, he yells at voices that our surveillance equipment has never picked up. He has spoken to himself about trips across vast, interstellar distances to realms no Guardian has ever described.\n\nAgain, he has not left the Annex in ages. One might say that I am overstepping even Praxic boundaries here, but I would say to them: the subject is free to leave any time.\n\n4. Following the results of my investigation, the subject has ceased regular reports to Lord Shaxx. I'm sure both prefer it that way. #1315 has broken none of the Vanguard's decrees in that time, nor have any further Guardians perished on his watch in Gambit or Reckoning. He is still a facilitator to murder and a thief, but he has done nothing to warrant eviction, as I had hoped. The Vanguard obviously still needs him.\n\n5. The following is a transcript of one of his late-night rambling sessions logged for evidence:\n\nTYPE: PRAXIC SURVEILLANCE REPORT\nPARTIES: One [1].

Steadfastness in the Traveler's dogma? Ha ha. That's not obtuse enough for y'all.\n[u.1:03] No, no. I don't think so. Because then you showed me a reality without shadows, of pure Light from every angle. Nowhere to hide. Everyone begging to die, like we did in the Dark Age. Light's no gift, but I already knew that. What else you got?\n[a metallic clink echoes]\n[u.1:04] Yeah. I know the coin doesn't lie. It's the only thing in this world I trust for real. But you know what? I control the coin. And I make my own fate. No one writes on this but me, you got that? You pencil-necked, phantom-assed geeks. Have some respect for people's stuff.\n[a second metallic clink]\n[u.1:05] I've refused the Traveler's dogma for generations.

        "description": "1.\n\nOn the day she boards the Yang Liwei, they call her Nasya Sarwar. She carries in her knapsack an unopened letter from her brother, her mother's ashes, a selection of seeds and cuttings from her favorite neighborhood trees and plants, and some thirty thousand songs and short videos on a hand-me-down myoelectric augment.\n\nOn the ship's manifest, Nasya Sarwar is one of two dozen classless Scopares, trash collectors and composters and caretakers devoted to endlessly tidying the many surfaces and people within the Yang Liwei that cannot or do not clean themselves. She hopes through hard work and perseverance, she will prove herself worthy of one of the ship's remaining civilian cryopods, or—even better—a promotion to an Auturge position where she believes she'll find the freedom to devote her waking hours entirely to the loving care of the ship's hydroponics facilities.\n\nNasya is quadrilingual. Several of her fellow Scopares are not: born monolinguals who got lucky in international Exodus lotteries, just like she did. When they realize that she can speak to some of them, they do their best to befriend her. They share meals. They show her photos of the loved ones they left behind. They explain the function of the ship's many impossible machines. In turn, she does her best to teach them how to speak to the others. In this way, they are all a little less alone.\n\nShe is twenty-seven years old.\n\n\n2.\n\nOn the day she awakens in the Distributary, she names herself Nasan Ar. She carries in her hands a small silver jar. A dent has crushed its lid; it is impossible to open. She does not know its provenance, but she feels an inexplicable tugging of grief in her chest when she thinks about walking on without it.\n\nShe makes herself a home under the largest tree she can find. In the early days, it is little more than a lean-to and a campfire, but she shares it willingly with whoever passes by. Her guests help her transform the lean-to into a proper cottage with several guest beds. One cottage becomes two, then two is three, until three becomes a village.\n\nNasan loves her guests and friends; she loves her little ramshackle community... but she never wished to become mother or mayor. Whenever they gather in the evening for dinner, she feels claustrophobic anxiety press tight around her. She is shackled to the earth by all these people that she loves, and she has no words to explain her own restlessness. She feels monstrous. Why doesn't she love this? Why doesn't she want to stay?\n\nOne clear night, amid the honey-heavy smell of spring flowers and recent rain, she takes her silver jar and goes out into the dripping dark.\n\n\n3.\n\nShe wanders. She tries on lives like she is trying on city-tailored fashions: for a few weeks, she is a Corsair. Then for a whole summer, she is a field hand. When she tires of that, she balances books for an atom merchant who trades in radioactive materials. Nothing holds her. Seeing her silver jar, one man suggests she may be a treasure hunter. The idea sends her deep into a subterranean cavern where she finds no treasure, but instead bioluminescent worms and a Paladin who calls herself Sjur Eido.\n\n\"If you're looking for a job,\" Sjur says, \"I should introduce you to my boss.\"\n\n\n4.\n\nOn the day Nasan finds her calling, the Diasyrm styles her a translator. It confuses her, because the Speech is the Speech. Variations have developed over time, but none are so distant from each other that two Awoken from around the world cannot speak to each other. \"What do you mean?\" Nasan asks.\n\n\"Well,\" the Diasyrm says. \"I've been watching since you arrived. People look to you when they're fighting, and you try to understand each side before you try to help. When you speak, you do it deftly, without condescension.\" She considers Nasan. \"It seems to me that you lend people grace when you help them explain themselves.\"\n\nA little candle of pride flickers in Nasan's throat. \"That's just mediation,\" she says, glancing away.\n\n\"Don't sell yourself short. Anyone can break up a fight. Few people can so clearly grasp the spirit of a thought, then rephrase it so that deaf ears hear it. Gifts like that can end wars.\" Thinking on that, the Diasyrm sobers. \"We'll have to keep your talent to ourselves, for now. The Sanguine would just as soon cut out your tongue.\"\n\n\n5.\n\nThe Theodicy War is a fact of life until it isn't. The killing stops, but the wounds remain. Nasan helps the Awoken mend. Her friends urge her to speak publicly, to help people on a grander scale, but Nasan believes the most effective change happens in groups of fewer than ten.",

        "description": "6.\n\nShe is standing in a crowd of thousands when Mara Sov tells the Awoken about the dying world they abandoned. The idea sucker-punches her—one crippling jab to every tender part of her. For four sleepless nights, she can scarcely draw a breath without gulping. She holds her silver jar to her forehead, focusing on its cool constant weight, and knows that she must leave.\n\n\n7.\n\nShe finds her old friend Sjur. Amid the feverish departure preparations, there is somehow time for an introduction to Mara. Nasan makes a pledge of herself and her skills. She will do what she can to convince those who might stay behind—\n\n\"No,\" Mara interrupts with the bite of unsweetened tea. \"I would not ask that of you or anyone else.\"\n\nNasan hesitates.\n\n\"Help those who have already made their choice, whatever it is. Help them with the grief.\" She clasps Nasan's hand. The stress around her eyes eases. \"That's more important.\"\n\n\n8.\n\nThe exodus is absolute in its terror. Nasan has never felt such a profound sense of schism—not when leaving lovers, nor communities, nor cherished hiding places.\n\nAs the Distributary shrinks behind their Hulls, she looks down at the little silver jar in her hands and wonders who she left behind in the world they're returning to protect. She wonders if they might still be alive.\n\n\n9.\n\nSjur is as plain and ready a companion as she ever was in the Diasyrm's camp, but Mara is an enigma. Nasan feels drawn to her, not by her porcelain beauty, but by her onion-skin layers of defense. There are so many different truths that ring through Mara's carefully chosen words: chords of nuanced meaning that she feels she might be able to separate out into cleaner notes for frightened minds craving simplicity.\n\nShe does what she can. In quiet hours and fragmented conversations, she becomes an unconventional counselor to the would-be queen.\n\nWhen the first fragile attempts at rebuilding society run afoul of the Long Unquiet Night, then the discovery of the Traveler and the Fallen, and then inevitably turn to riot and desertion, Nasan goes to Mara again to pledge her services. \"Let me go after them,\" she begs, not a day after the proclamation that they all hear in their skulls instead of their ears. \"I don't mean to change their minds or convince them to come back. I just—\"\n\n\"Then what DO you mean to do?\" Sjur asks curiously. Mara watches her with ageless patience, waiting for her to find the words.\n\nNasan purses her lips. \"I want them to understand that you are—that you—that you are good. That you aren't what they think.\" Seeing Sjur bristle, she holds up her hand. To her relief, Mara makes a slight warding gesture as well. \"And if they know that and still wish to live apart from us on Earth, that's fine. That's their choice.\"\n\n\"I don't need them to understand that,\" Mara says softly. There is the faintest husk of grief in her steady voice.\n\n\"No,\" Nasan agrees, relieved that Mara is willing to consider this truth. \"You don't. You have the courage to be disliked, and that is uncommon. But it is just as important, sometimes, to cultivate good will...\" Especially if you have forgotten what it feels like to not know everything, she thinks.\n\nMara looks away. Nasan watches closely and thinks that perhaps she has been heard. Sjur shifts her weight impatiently, tired by all this meaningful silence. It has been a long nineteen hours.\n\n\"If you go,\" Mara says finally, \"you cannot come back.\"\n\nNasan hears the truth in it. She reaches to clasp Mara's hand. \"Of course.\"\n\n\n10.\n\nSo she goes to Earth. She carries a survival kit, a hunting rifle, and the tarnished silver jar that has followed her through her whole existence.\n\nShe finds no Awoken as she wanders an empty prairie. She spreads no gospel.\n\nIt is not two weeks before a band of Risen—wild with fear of themselves, each other, and the unknown—ambush her lonely campsite and kill her in her sleep.",

Marrow-deep instinct drives that decision; she could not declare its etymology if someone held a knife to her throat.\n\nGol explains that there is a settlement a few days' walk to the east, that there is no road, and that the wilderness is regularly patrolled by roving aliens who will try to kill them both. As he speaks, Orin looks around. They are surrounded by a young forest vivacious with birds and clouds of gnats. It is impossible to imagine that a deadly alien might be lurking somewhere nearby. But Gol found her. Gol knows more about the world than she does. She trusts him.\n\nShe scavenges the leaf litter until she finds a fallen tree limb. \"Will this help?\" she asks him, testing its heft. He twists his wings, puzzled. \"...Against the aliens,\" she elaborates.\n\n\"Oh.\" Courteous, he pretends to consider it, then, \"No. Probably not. They have guns.\"\n\n\"I see,\" she says, though she doesn't. She breaks off the smaller branches, using her foot for leverage. Soon, she has a crude mace. It is heavy, slow, and does not break when she tests it against a tree trunk.\n\nShe doesn't know what the aliens look like. She does not know what guns are.  She does trust Gol. But, she can't help thinking, if an alien tried to attack her while she was armed with a stick like this, she would have no trouble crushing its skull.\n\n\n12.\n\nThey reach the settlement. It is smoldering cinder and ruin. Gol frets about \"fission products\" and \"acute radiation,\" so Orin lingers at a distance and studies what remains. A cat moves among the most distant rubble, hunting for mice. A tattered banner stirs in the breeze. She sees nothing more, so she ignores Gol's warning and goes in for a closer look.\n\nShe finds bodies. Adults, mostly. Some children. There are little houses for big animals, but there are no big animals among the dead.\n\n\"How did this happen?\" she asks, overcome by grief for these charred strangers. \"Aliens?\"\n\n\"I doubt it. The Fallen don't often use nuclear weapons. It ruins the land. My guess is that a Warlord raided this place for its livestock and then set off a bomb.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nGol gives a little shrug, bobbing in place. \"Why not? No one was here to stop them.\"\n\nOrin clenches her mace a little tighter. She feels nauseous. \"Can you tell when it happened?\"\n\nHe runs the computations. \"Not precisely. Less than thirty-six hours ago, I suppose.\"\n\n\"I should have walked faster,\" she mutters, and then bends over to be sick.\n\n\"You can't do that here,\" Gol interrupts anxiously. \"Stop, Orin. Stop. You have radiation poisoning. If you're sick here, you'll die here, and then I'll have to resurrect you here, and you'll be sick and die again and again. You have to move. Come. I told you not to walk around here.\"",

She hunts them to better hunt Warlords, and makes many enemies of many older, wilier Risen than she.\n\n\n14.\n\nThe Pilgrim Guard finds her pinned down in a box canyon, fighting alone and out of ammunition against a gang of six mercenaries. She is a graceless fighter with an unflappably grim resolve, so when they sweep in to help her, she does not immediately recognize them as the cavalry; she sees them coming, considers the odds, and then raises her empty Scorch Cannon to wield as a maul. Seventeen to one? She'll try her luck.\n\nThey laugh about it later over weak tea and hardtack.\n\n\n15.\n\nWhen the Guard invites her to join them, they present her with a war hammer. It is as tall as she is. Along its grip, they've engraved the words I AM THE END OF ALL THINGS in tidy block print.\n\n\n16.\n\nShe meets a young woman whose skin looks like hers.\n\n\"Where did you come from?\" Orin asks, staring too hard, standing a little too close. It is impossible not to: every other blue-skinned person she has ever seen has either been dead or a distant figure hurrying for a gleaming ship.\n\nThe young woman cringes away from her. \"The Sinaloan ruins.\"\n\n\"Are there other people there like you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nHearing her question, one of her friends pulls her aside to point up at the sky. \"Your people are up there,\" he says. \"They live among the asteroids.\"\n\n\"Why aren't they here?\" she asks, but he has no answer.\n\n\n17.\n\nThe everyday rhythm of the Pilgrim Guard suits her for decades: eradicate Warlords and alien invaders; protect mortal civilians; guide homeless refugees to safety. Their numbers wax and wane over time, but they are forever the watchers-in-the-dark, the living-shield-that-shelters, the ladder-which-humanity-will-climb-toward-rebirth. Inspiring campfire speeches are an endless fact of life, and they buoy her until she begins to recognize the leitmotifs of self-sacrificing heroism.\n\nOrin loves her leaders and friends; she loves her little ramshackle community... but she never wished to become soldier or symbol.

Rumors call it \"The Last Safe City,\" a place of peace and prosperity guarded by indestructible Old Russian warriors who fight alongside twenty-foot-tall wolves (whatever those are).\n\nThe Pilgrim Guard has heard of many so-called safe cities. They come and go, but mostly they go.\n\nStill, they reroute their caravan. The land down south is good: arable, temperate, and with too many indigenous parasites for the Fallen to wish it as a customary home. Even if there is no safe city there, it is a better place to guide civilians than the ravaged deserts and plains of the north.\n\nOrin hopes the rumors are true, but it is a selfish hope: If the city is real, and people are safe there, then maybe she can rest.\n\n\n19.\n\n\"City\" is a misnomer; it has been a misnomer since this place's inception. It is a chaotic sprawl of tents and shabby lean-tos. There is not a single permanent structure among them. The streets are nothing more than muddy pathways that smell of waste and smoke. But the people! Neither Orin nor Gol have seen so many people in all their lives.\n\nFilthy children scream with laughter as they play tag around salvaged tanks. A civilian militia stands vigil over cassava farmers. Armored Risen bicker over where they should mark the city's borders and how best to defend them.\n\nThe Traveler looms overhead as Orin wanders through it all, wide-eyed and exhilarated.\n\n\n20.\n\nThe Pilgrim Guard prepares to move out, provisioned to make an eighteen-month expedition through the far north. Orin stays behind. No one questions her decision, though they do grieve it. Each one of them cuts a notch into the grip of her war hammer until it reads I I I I I I I I I AM THE END OF ALL THINGS.\n\n\n21.\n\nThere are Awoken here in this safe city. They are uncommon, though Exos are even rarer. Most have Ghosts, as she does. A few do not, and it's these people that Orin is most fascinated by.\n\nShe dogs them with relentless patience, asking question after question: Where did you come from? Why have you come here? Where are the rest of us? Where did you get that gun? What are those bullets made out of? Why doesn't everyone have those bullets? Do people ever move to avoid you? Do you hear voices when you are alone? Are your dreams ever like omens? If I was one of you, why didn't anyone ever come looking for me?",

His Hildian sustained damage during a dog-fight with a Fallen skiff, and now an important pump is leaking. He cannot find the source of the leak, nor does he have the supplies to repair it. The rest of the Awoken are at home, in the Reef.\n\nThe gun is a standard-issue Tigerspite AR; it uses cased telescoped rounds made of a proprietary plasteel-spinmetal blend. There are engineers hard at work on manufacturing techniques that will allow for widespread distribution of the weapon to Risen and civilian populations on Earth.\n\nPeople do avoid him. Earthborn and Risen Awoken almost never speak to him; he is surprised that she bothered. He does hear voices; he does have prophetic dreams. He describes it all in detail and she is shocked by how familiar it sounds. It is like listening to a recording of herself.\n\nAt her final question, he hesitates. He runs a grimy hand through his hair and looks up at the stars. They have been talking a long time. \"If we're going to talk some more,\" he says at last, \"we might as well have a drink.\"\n\n\n23.\n\nNamqi is not particularly tall, nor particularly handsome. Taken in isolation, parts of him are beautiful. His nose. His hands. The lines of his throat. The coruscating light that passes over his skin fascinates her; she watches to see if its patterns match her own. They do not.\n\nMost of all, Orin is struck by his ability to listen with empathy. He is quiet more often than not. Long silences don't frighten him. And when he speaks, he does it deftly, without condescension.\n\n\n24.\n\nIt takes eight weeks to repair the leaking pump. In that time, Orin convinces Namqi to break queenslaw and smuggle her and Gol beyond the Vestian Outpost. She is determined to understand why she revolted against her own people.\n\nThey are scarcely a half-day's burn toward Interamnia before they are intercepted by Galliots painted in the Queen's colors.\n\n\n25.\n\n\"Woof,\" Sjur Eido says when she sees Orin for the first time, \"Mara's gonna hate this.\" She crosses the detainment cell to get a better look at Gol. \"Figured this might happen eventually, but I'd always hoped...\" She pulls at the nape of her neck, then gives a little half-shrug: well, what can you do.\n\nTurning, she looks at Namqi. \"You know you broke the law, right?\"\n\nHe nods.\n\nShe claps him on the shoulder and smiles. \"My man.\"\n\n\n26.\n\nTwo Paladins deliver her to Mara Sov. Gol is not permitted in the court, nor is Namqi.\n\n\"I knew you,\" Orin says before Mara can speak. It is uncourtly etiquette, she supposes, but they are alone and she is too bold to fear offense.\n\n\"What do you remember?\"\n\nOrin gives a slight shake of her head. Moments pass. Mara, too, is comfortable with silence. Behind her mask of composed indifference, her eyes are sharp with curiosity.\n\n\"Why did I leave?\" Orin asks.\n\n\"You wished to be my emissary.\"\n\n\"And you banished me for it?\" She squints. \"That doesn't seem like something you'd do...\"\n\nMara smiles faintly. \"No.\"\n\n\n27.\n\nThey have several more conversations.\n\nThe revelations are absolute in their terror. Orin has never felt such a profound sense of schism—not when learning that most mortals would sooner swallow cyanide pills than come face-to-face with a Risen, nor that the Eliksni were once abandoned by the Traveler, nor that almost all Warlords are Lightbearers.\n\n\n28.\n\nBut the queenslaw is, of course, the queenslaw. It must be upheld—but the spirit of the law often differs from its letter.\n\nNamqi accepts a sentence of five years' indentured servitude to the crown for smuggling Orin into Reef holdings. They let him pick his detail and negotiate his salary.\n\nOrin's case is not so simple. She is not who she was, so after vigorous philosophical debate, it is decreed that she cannot be held accountable for her past oaths. But she engaged in witting trespass, aided and abetted by a learned civilian, and for that, she must sacrifice a boon: an unnamed future debt of the crown's choosing.\n\nOrin accepts the sentence gladly and returns to Earth to mend her wounds.

When she continues her hunt for the Queen, she feels a crushing fist around her windpipe. There is something she must say, but she has no words to say it. There is somewhere she must go. Someone she must be.\n\nIt is not horrifying, though she thinks it should be. Instead, it is unspeakably lonely.\n\n\n36.\n\nIt grows steadily worse, until it is not possible to tell the difference between day and dream.\n\nShe tries to describe her number-color synesthesia to Gol, to Namqi, to Mara. She sees green and thinks \"nine.\" She reads \"purple\" and tastes nine.\n\nThey all tell her to stop. To rest. To be still. There have been other breakthroughs. Other messages. The Nine are known.\n\nShe cannot.\n\nShe hunts for the man with the writhing face.\n\nShe hunts for herself.\n\n\n37.\n\nOn the day that Namqi dies, no one can reach her or Gol, though they do try.\n\nShe does not find out for months.\n\n\n38.\n\nOn the day she meets Wu Ming, she is on Bamberga. She has just left a Gensym lab. She has just read a transcript of Namqi's last words. Her hands are shaking. She feels nauseous. She feels she can see herself in third-person, tottering to a safe place to sit and cry.\n\nWu Ming is a bonfire in the darkness, and she crawls toward his warmth.\n\n\n39.\n\nWu Ming is ravenous for her stories of the Nine. He asks whether she's met them, whether they can give a man power, whether they know a way out of this solar system. Orin cannot answer any of his questions but she cannot keep her own stories down. She is sick with them; they come out in a compulsive bilious stream and when she is emptied, she talks of herself. Of her grief. Of her restlessness. How she feels the most alive in the empty spaces between blinks. How she feels she is a snake perpetually sloughing away its skin, except this last molt is all wrong and she is caught in the ghost-throat of her old self.\n\nWu Ming leaves his questions by the wayside as he is drawn inexorably into the gravity well of her desperate honesty. Her confessions lower his defenses. He talks of himself. Of his fear. Of his loneliness. How he feels he is one fingernail away from plummeting into an abyss. How he feels vicious resentment every time he is brought back from the dead: He never asked for the gift of the Light.\n\n\n40.\n\nThey make excuse after excuse to meet again. Every conversation is colored by excavated truths; every day they feel they will reach some bedrock that will break them to pieces. It is as frightening as it is intoxicating.\n\n\n41.\n\nLies!\n\nLies!\n\nLies!\n\nHe is not Wu Ming—he is a man named Eli—a man named Dredgen Hope—a man named the Drifter—\n\nHe is not vulnerable—he is a paranoid con man—he is a dead-hearted murderer—he is a cowardly liar—\n\nHe is not her friend—he is waiting to make his move—he has ALWAYS been waiting to make his move—\n\nShe is stupid; she is so stupid to have fallen for his lies!\n\nShe cannot mend this!\n\n\n42.\n\nShe leaves and so too does the Light. The severance is absolute in its terror. She has not felt such a profound sense of—\n\nS C H I S M?\n\nit can be mended\n\nOrin is not your name.",

AUDIO UNAVAILABLE.\n\nSince its inception, the Vanguard has served as the City's greatest deterrent against total annihilation of humankind. And for an Age, it succeeded without question.\n\nBut today's Vanguard has never faced a threat like the Drifter. This man with no name and no verified history in the City's files has brought an ideological war to our doorstep. He's a greater threat than any Hive god or Vex Mind because I can't walk down to the Annex with a shotgun and end him.\n\nThe Vanguard won't allow it. They see a rogue element they can control.\n\nI see a criminal in a place of power.\n\nThe Praxic Order has been surveilling Vanguard activities: Guardians like you are abandoning frontline duties so they can run rampant in the Drifter's Gambit.\n\nEvery Mote of Dark they drop in his hands means another moment that the paracausal phenomenon in the Dreaming City is left unchecked. That our enemies in Deadzones across the Earth push our borders. In the absence of Light, even the Hellmouth on the Moon is stirring.\n\nThis cannot last. Ontological and genocidal threats aside, Gambit encourages the use of Darkness to fight Darkness... and other Guardians.\n\nSince the City's foundation, the Praxic Order has existed to keep Darkness and other banned assets out of the hands of City Guardians. Despite our best efforts, pieces like the Red Death, Crimson... and certain Weapons of Sorrow... continue to find their way into City arsenals. But even Guardian killers like those are nothing compared to the ideological threat of Gambit. Gambit leads to Darkness.\n\nAnd Darkness is the Hive on the Moon, tearing our kind to pieces in the Great Disaster. The Darkness is the Red War, the tower-fall—when the Cabal silenced the Traveler and killed thousands of the last humans on Earth in a single day. The Darkness is the Vex erasing our allies from existence, from memory itself. The Darkness is one man, with the power to deal final death in his fist. The Darkness was the Collapse of the Golden Age.\n\nThe Darkness is peace by annihilation in myriad ways.\n\nAs a sword of the Praxic Order, it is my duty to seek out those who would consort with or study the Darkness as a religious or paracausal entity. Participating in Gambit is problematic, but Guardians will go to where the guns are. If the Order wants to win this, the Drifter must fall. If I can get solid evidence that bastard is causing demonstrable harm, the Praxic Order will descend on him like a second sun.\n\nI know the Drifter has your ear, but consider this:\n\nThere's more to being a Guardian of the City than power.",

AUDIO UNAVAILABLE.\n\n[The transcript has been bundled alongside the shattered remains of a Ghost.]\n\nThis Ghost belonged to a renegade Guardian, recently deceased in a shootout with Praxic elements in the City.\n\nHis Guardian, an equally dead Titan, went by another title:\n\nDredgen.\n\nThis pair were ideological followers of Dredgen Yor.\n\nNo reason for veterans of the Red War to brush up on late Dark Age history, so in case you haven't heard: Yor was among the first of our kind to kill another with the heretical use of Darkness. Even a Guardian can't come back from that.\n\nAll those who used his name in recent history belonged to an outlaw group called the Shadows of Yor. No two of them can agree on Yor's true ideology, but all strive to consort with the Darkness for power. According to the testimony of his former fireteams, Drifter was one of them. And might still be.\n\nThe group hasn't made an appearance in a long time. There are rumors of new \"Dredgens\" taking up the mantle at the behest of the Drifter. All relatively young Guardians: the Old Russian cohort or the Red War. Not the old blood of the original group.\n\nYou might be one of them. Or soon could be.\n\nJust know that I've confirmed some, perhaps all, of the old blood are back in town. The Ghost you hold in your hand belonged to one of them.\n\nAnd I would not be surprised if the renegade who hunts the Shadows, the Hunter who forged the Golden Gun itself, was close behind.\n\nI don't know why the Shadows have returned, but there are possibilities:\n\nTo Drifter's chagrin I'm sure, it's no secret City Guardians are playing with Darkness in the form of Gambit. Maybe the Shadows want to actively recruit. They've tried and failed in the past to put the use of Darkness into Guardian arsenals.\n\nBut the Drifter and the Shadows could be at odds. The man is a loner and a cheat, building as many bridges as he burns in the Guardian community. He has true allegiance to nothing and no one but himself. It's possible he's gathering Gambit regulars to defend himself from his own kind.\n\nOr the Dredgens are here to help their ally, the Drifter, with the operation of Gambit or some new, unknown goal.\n\nI share all this with you hoping for your confidence. The Drifter is not to be trusted. Involve yourself with him and the Dredgens at your own risk. Even if you carry their name, it's not too late to make the right choice.\n\nDon't end up like the Ghost in your hand. He did not die well.",

Used to be that every couple years or so, somebody would get to talking to Xûr, then they'd decide that they were going to be the great mind to crack the mystery of the Nine. Go off to find them. Bunch of Cryptarchs, mostly. A couple Guardians. Then the Light went out during the Red War, and one last ambitious mind went out in search of providence: a Sunbreaker by the name of Orin.\n\nShe came back as the Emissary. Set up the Trials, said the Nine were standing ready to judge the worthiest among us—for what, we don't know. Seems they like strong warriors. The disappearances have stopped since then. I should note here that a couple people called those disappearances \"abductions.\"\n\nWord of advice? Try to keep emotional language out of your reports.\n\nTo the knowledge of the Praxic Order, the Nine aren't allies of the Darkness. We've got solid intel from Reef spies that the Awoken Queen's working with them now beyond the system. Could be that they're up to no good, but—whatever's out there is apparently more important than all that suffering in the Dreaming City, and every Corsair I've talked to believes that through and through. I believe their belief. The Awoken have too much self-respect to live under a bad leader. Bad's different than popular, of course.\n\nAnyway, I don't think the Nine or their Emissary intend to harm you—not right now, at least. It'd be helpful if we knew what they wanted with Drifter, but... That investigation is up to you. If you pursue it and you get a whiff of trouble, you tell me.\n\nJust remember the rest of us when you're out there changing the fabric of spacetime, or whatever the hell it is they do.",

It's too bad the Vanguard keeps you so busy.\n\nThis is the end of our investigation.\n\nThose tapes you found contain the scraps of truth that we've been hunting all this time. It's just not the truth that I was expecting—I've been looking at that man expecting a dangerous criminal mind. Living, breathing, evil the likes of Dredgen Yor, and instead, I got... What. Tragedy? Pathos?\n\nWell.\n\nHe's pathetic, all right.\n\nI've made my final report to the Order, and I am comfortable with the decree they've issued: the Drifter shall remain under close watch, but he presents no direct threat for as long as he cooperates with the Vanguard and Lord Shaxx. This brings us into consensus with the Vanguard's standing judgment.\n\nThe Shadows of Yor that Gambit conned out of hiding have been thugs with guns and Ghosts, mostly. They have less bite than the Dredgens of yore. Little wonder Shin Malphur didn't show up. These fools aren't worth his time.\n\nI'm trying to take this as a lesson in the dangers of presumption, but in my defense, the Drifter smelled like a rat.

        "description": "In a campsite on a cliff above the salt mines of Trostland, a man with a Golden Gun held two Guardians hostage. Behind them, an ashen silhouette smoldered on the cliffside.\n\n\"I gave you every chance,\" said the man with the Golden Gun. \"Any last words?\"\n\nOne hostage lifted his head and took a breath. Before he could speak, his skull erupted in a bloom of Arc Light. A Void arrow lanced through the air and lodged in the throat of the second hostage. He slumped over, falling against his dead companion.\n\nThe man turned to look in the direction of the shots. The Golden Gun blazed bright in his fist.\n\nThe Ghosts of the dead Guardians materialized to resurrect their fallen charges—but were cut short as two restraining bands whistled through the trees and snapped across their frames.\n\nThe Ghosts fell, enervated by Arc pulses flowing from their restraints.\n\nLoose pebbles murmured down the cliffside as six Warlocks dressed in black dusters entered the camp single-file. They all carried Quitclaim shotguns.\n\nThe man did not move.\n\nThe woman leading the Warlocks stepped closer to the man. She held out a Cormorant Seal, fearless in the light of his ever-burning Gun. \"Aunor. Praxic Order.\"\n\n\"You're interrupting important work,\" he said.\n\n\"Stole the words right out of my mouth,\" she replied. \"These Ghosts are coming with us. No more killing. Your reputation won't protect you.\"\n\n\"Your jurisdiction ends in the City,\" came the reply. \"These two are my problem to solve.\"\n\nAunor glowered. \"They're third-degree offenders. Consorting with the Darkness on a material level only, collecting and concealing illegal artifacts. We'll rehabilitate and reeducate them if we need to.\"\n\n\"And they will continue behind your backs. They're already addicted. Power corrupts.\"\n\n\"You're costing us Ghosts—means to fight enemies of humanity. These Guardians represent more than potential Dredgens—\"\n\n\"Men like this will destroy you from within.\"\n\n\"Based on the sins of one man?\"\n\n\"My struggle is older than yours, Warlock Aunor, and it will be here when your Praxic laws are forgotten and the Last City is dust.\"\n\n\"You, and Shaxx, and the Vanguard, and all the deal-makers are going to get the City killed.\"\n\nThe man traded his Golden Gun from one hand to another and sighed. Aunor racked the Quitclaim. Her Warlocks followed her lead.\n\nThe man stood. \"Shaxx wouldn't like it if you all came home in pieces. Take them. I'll be watching. They so much as breathe wrong and they're mine.\"\n\nHe walked into the forest, fist still aflame. The campsite fell to darkness as he disappeared.\n\n\"Secure the Ghosts,\" Aunor ordered her team, holstering her weapon to begin a thorough sweep of the site.",

        "description": "The Shadows had her Ghost. They had somehow gotten their hands on restraint tech—Praxic tech.\n\nShe'd have to follow up on that some time. If she lived.\n\nNo Man with a Golden Gun. No fireteam. No backup.\n\nShe had been chasing a lead on a group of new-blood Dredgens, taking her Sparrow over Veridian Bridge to a local Gensym lab. But the Shadows were waiting for her.\n\nFrom a hidden vantage point on an overpass above, a single rocket from a shoulder-mounted launcher had obliterated the road in front of her. She'd been thrown straight off her machine.\n\nIn that split second, she saw Bahaghari had tried to catch her in a beam of Light, but with a telltale whistle and snap, a restraining band had silenced her Ghost. She was falling by then.\n\nShe leaned into the roaring wind, transitioned her fall into a dive. The impact and temperature of the water shocked and chilled her to the bone as debris rained into the lake around her.\n\nShe started the long swim toward shore, toward a road she knew would take her to the overpass.\n\n**\n\nShe pulled up onto the overpass on a hijacked Pike and looked down at the smoldering wreckage of the bridge where she had fallen an hour ago. Bahaghari was nowhere in sight, but her helmet's visor picked up an echo of Void discharge from a sniper's vantage. It was consistent with the launch pattern of a shoulder-mounted Countess SA/2.\n\nShe patched it back to Drifter, and in return, he gave her the coordinates of three possible Shadow safehouses in the area. Without Bahaghari, she had to input them manually to her tracker HUD.\n\nShe selected the farthest one from her position and gunned the Pike.\n\n**\n\nBy the time she pulled up to an abandoned warehouse in District 125, the Shadows had already ransomed her Ghost on several City bands. They wanted clearance to take their jumpships out of the system by midnight. Without clearance, they'd kill Bahaghari.\n\nThe Vanguard ignored the missive entirely. Renegades were not to be negotiated with. Not even Osiris himself. And these Shadows were no Osiris.\n\nThe maglev train coming from Core East roared on a rail above. The next train would arrive at midnight.\n\nShe could see a light on the top floor of the rust-red building, and the silhouettes of several people.\n\n\"I'm not on that floor,\" Bahaghari said. Aunor started.\n\n\"How—\"\n\n\"I hacked the restraint. It's Praxic tech. We've got a renegade in the Order.\"\n\n\"Worry about that later. You said you're not on the top floor?\"\n\n\"No. The basement. Under the street. Building's empty except for us. Don't even think about a breach, you'll need a team. Or a Gjallarhorn.\"\n\n\"Don't have either, Bighari.\"\n\n\"Don't even think about it.\"\n\n\"I didn't say anything.\"\n\n\"You never call me that unless you're about to do something stupid.\"\n\n**\n\nShe had never driven a maglev train before. She liked the feel of power in the front car, watching the world hurtle past.\n\nThe train was empty. She had ordered all the passengers and the conductor off before she'd requisitioned it. You could convince people to do almost anything with a Cormorant Seal.\n\nThe turn came rushing up, and she keyed a control on her wrist.\n\nA series of proximity mines on the rail and the barrier that supported it exploded, and the train hurtled forward through the smoke and fire—\n\nDown onto a rust-red warehouse building far below.\n\n**\n\nShe could see everything Bahaghari could see, even in death.\n\nFor those inside the building, it was like the world was ending.\n\nBut her Ghost was free, heading straight for the front car of the train that had impaled the upper floor of the warehouse. A pair of injured Shadows, the only survivors, were right behind her as she came up to Aunor's slumped body, her eye blazing with Light.\n\nAunor emerged from a radiant column and ducked under the bleeding Shadow's haymaker, slamming a blazing palm into his gut. She burned straight through him and rolled forward on the momentum, under a thundering shot from the second Shadow's hand cannon.\n\nShe transitioned the roll into a stiff sidekick from the ground, shattering the man's unarmored knee. She mounted him as he fell and bludgeoned him unconscious with a rain of burning elbows.\n\nBahaghari came up behind her. \"There are three more bodies... somewhere under this train. What now?\"\n\nAunor stood up, covered in blood and ash.\n\n\"We take their Ghosts. Alert the Vanguard. We have five renegades in custody.\"\n\nAunor found her duster in the train cab, tattered and badly burnt. She put it on, clasped her Cormorant Seal in place, and sat next to the bodies, waiting for her prisoners' Ghosts to materialize.\n\nHer radio clicked.\n\n\"No casualties. You did well,\" Ikora said.\n\n\"Are you speaking as the head of the Warlocks or the head of the Hidden?\" Aunor returned.\n\n\"As your friend. You slipped, but you saved it. Zavala and I appreciate your help in this. It's imperative—\"\n\n\"That Drifter and Gambit continue, yes.\"\n\n\"Aunor.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Are we good? We're asking a lot of you.\"\n\n\"I don't ever want your job. And the City needs that rat man's connections and his means. If he can bring Orin back to us...\"\n\n\"Mm. Let's talk more in the morning.\"\n\nShe looked out the viewport at the burning train rail above, and the ruins of the warehouse around her.\n\nShe supposed this was her life now.",

As he walked, he wrapped the cloth around himself, covering his head and hiding his face. He changed his gait and his posture by degrees as he walked: moving a little slower, hunching a little lower. When he emerged into the next atrium, it was as though he had aged by sixty years.\n\nSpotting a group of elders basking in the sun, he shuffled over to sit down as one of them.\n\n\"You new here?\" one of them rasped.\n\n\"Always feels like it,\" he replied in a reedy lilt.\n\n\"I know what you mean,\" the elder said, staring at a squad of passing Titans whose armor reflected the sky. \"They always stay the same,\" he gestured at them. \"Everything around them changes on their whims. For good or ill.\"\n\n\"You're not wrong.\" It wasn't what he had meant. Once traffic died down, he could head straight for the Annex. No Guardians to pester him about rules or payout changes to Gambit.\n\nHe hated going out there with the Lights. Their earnestness pissed him off. He only did it 'cuz he had to eat. What he loved about Gambit was one thing, and one thing only: delectable Motes of Dark.\n\nThe bench creaked as someone sat down beside him. He didn't bother to look up. They'd go away eventually.\n\n\"Turns out your info was solid,\" a voice said. \"To my surprise.\"\n\nHe turned to look, and saw a woman: brown-skinned, crooked-nosed, with intelligent eyes and a hard stare. She wore a black duster, and light armor underneath. A Warlock. He didn't know her. \"You've mistaken me, my dear,\" he quavered.\n\nShe handed him an intricately designed slate about the size of a Titan's fist. A Cormorant Seal.\n\n\"The info you sold us on the Shadows was solid,\" she repeated. \"Are you switching sides?\"\n\nHe blinked. No use pretending. He dropped the act, sitting straighter. \"I'm on no side but my own. Are they alive?\"\n\nThe elders to his right frowned and began talking lowly amongst themselves.\n\n\"All but one. We couldn't get there before our mutual friend started his work.\"\n\n \"Those three were idiots. Chasing legends. No danger to anyone but themselves.\"\n\n\"I don't think you have a good gauge for that. But they're in custody now.\"\n\n\"If you're done, I'd like to spend more quality time with my blanket and these crusty fellows.\"\n\n\"We listened to your protégé's tapes,\" she said.\n\n\"You bastards,\" he said, with no fire in it.\n\n\"The Vanguard think they can use you,\" she said.\n\n\"And what do you think?\"\n\n\"You're a criminal not to be trusted. But... Orin gave you a chance.\"\n\nHe turned to look at her.\n\n\"And I think you think you can bring her back,\" she continued. He said nothing, but he didn't look away, either.\n\nAunor stood up. \"As you were.\"",

The holoprojection flickers; the whole Skiff tilts seventy degrees off-kilter. The Captain holds tight to the table, reaching out with a secondary arm to snatch the Hunter as he goes toppling by.

They welcome him into their lean little camp. They feed him: clean water, unseasoned rabbit, a tiny dipper of honey. They entertain him: rumors, jokes, an epic that takes more than an hour and a half to tell. These are the first Risen he has ever met, and he quickly decides he wants to be just like them.\n\nThere is one woman among them that stands out. Her skin is like his. As the fire dies down and people go off to sleep or stand watch, he finds an excuse to sit next to her. He is shy; he does not know what to say. As she chips dried viscera off the head of a maul as tall as she is, she glances up for a moment. \"How long since you were rezzed?\" she asks.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Sorry—since your friend woke you up.\" She juts her chin at his Ghost, then goes back to cleaning her weapon.\n\n\"Oh, uh...\" He looks to Ghost.\n\n\"Six days,\" Ghost supplies.\n\n\"How long was he dead?\" she asks Ghost. Therin turns to look, waiting for the answer. That question didn't even occur to him.\n\nGhost spins her shell, thinking. \"It's hard to say exactly. Not long. Perhaps a month?\" She nudges his cheek affectionately. \"You were disgusting.\"\n\nThe woman nods thoughtfully, then reaches out to rub the corner of his cloak between thumb and forefinger.\n\n\"Why?\" Therin asks after a moment.\n\n\"Never seen clothes like yours, is all,\" the woman shrugs. She lets go, looks back to Ghost. \"You pull him out of a shipwreck, maybe?\"\n\nGhost nods. \"Yes.\"\n\nTherin squints, puzzled. Seeing that, the woman points the end of her war hammer up to the sky. \"You and me, we come from the same people. And those people are up there.\"\n\n\"Yeah? What do you know about them?\"\n\nThe woman shakes her head. \"Not much. I know that we must have left them for a reason. Don't worry about them so much.\" She pats his knee. \"You gotta figure yourself out first. You know who you are?\"\n\n\"Therin Vai,\" he says, confidently.\n\nShe smiles. \"Therin Vai,\" she echoes, and the confidence in her voice makes the name sound more legitimate, more real, than when he shared it with just Ghost.\n\nThey fall quiet again. A log in the fire snaps.\n\n\"You think I can stay with you all?\" he asks eventually, full of cautious optimism.\n\nThe woman looks at his tattered cloak, his knives, his lean build. He is not one of them, not by a long shot, and she knows it even if he doesn't yet—but he doesn't sense that judgment in her voice. He hears only kindness when she says, \"Of course.

We owe them all more than we're giving.\"\n\n\"Yes…\" he agreed, then added gently, \"But they owe us more than they're giving, too.\"\n\nIkora chuckled dryly. \"Yes. Of course. The benefit of the doubt. And compassion. But.\" She squinted against the rain. \"Our feelings don't matter right now. We need to be people they want to follow, not people they mistrust and want to fight.\"\n\n\"Respect is mutual,\" Zavala said, \"but I agree.\" He took a deep breath, looking up at the belly of the Traveler: present but inert. Completely, maddeningly, heartrendingly inert. \"We will be better. This will pass.\"\n\nIkora closed her eyes.\n\nThey were quiet a while.\n\n\"I wish Cayde were here,\" she whispered.\n\nZavala set his hand on Ikora's knee and swallowed a knot in his throat. \"Me, too.\"",

SOMEWHERE ELSE.\n\n\nI activated the mechanism that opened my chamber doors. The massive gears on either side shrieked in protest as they ground against themselves to wrench the massive, solid-plasteel gates open. It took whole minutes to complete the sequence.\n\nA tiny, tiny man sped through the now-gaping maw of the gates on a tiny Earth machine. It took him several minutes more to reach earshot of me, leaving a billowing trail of dust in his wake. I'm afraid my chamber had not been cleaned in some time. Cleanliness meant nothing to me now. I had not entertained an audience so directly in centuries. But I was as curious about this creature as it was of me.\n\nThe miniscule man dismounted his machine and stared up. I pictured I would relish the moment when his eyes went wide at the sight of my grandeur.\n\nBut he didn't seem to care. He frowned a little. Fascinating.\n\n\"Is that you?\" he asked, voice echoing upwards at me. \"The real you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, and the metal around me rattled and shook at my speech. It was the truth. \"One of me. Refreshment?\"\n\nI activated a mechanism in the floor, raising a miniscule but ornate table out of the dusty metal deck. A single, equally tiny chalice, filled to the brim with royal nectar wine, sat on its center.\n\n\"No thanks,\" the man said. \"Last time I drank an alien something, I had a gunfight with what came outta' me.\"\n\n\"What can Emperor Calus do for you?\" I asked him.\n\nI pretended to stare at him. In doing so, I analyzed every fiber of his being at a spectrum level. I had always expected he was a Guardian. But there was something else. A shade of something that reminded me of the black edge. So the tiny man liked to play outside the Light.\n\n \"I got somewhere to be, so I'll make this short. Where do you and I stand? I need these Guardians as much as you do. We gonna start fighting for territory soon?\"\n\n\"The Shadows are mine,\" I boomed, pelting him with my voice. He winced. I wasn't angry. I didn't have it in me to be angry anymore. But he had to know.\n\n\"So that's a yes,\" he muttered, and flipped a jade coin into the air with a clink that echoed throughout the massive chamber.\n\n\"There isn't a sane being in this whole system,\" he grumbled up at the coin, then caught it.\n\n\"I'm not sure I know what you mean,\" I said. It was truth. Data from my spectral analysis of the peasant continued to pour in.\n\nHe stared at me. \"You're crazy. Those Guardians you got working for you—they're crazy. The Vanguard's crazy.\"\n\nHe looked down at his coin. \"I might be crazy.\"\n\nHe chuckled, suddenly. \"I leave the system for a couple hundred years and everything goes to hell.\" He shook his head. \"Look at you. The Cabal Emperor isn't even Cabal anymore. Right?\"\n\n\"I am the last thing this system shall ever see,\" I replied. My scan was finished. And so was this man's welcome in my abode. I think he knew, because he turned to leave.\n\n\"You come after what's mine, and I've got friends in low places who'll tear your house down,\" he called back to me. I glimpsed his smile, and it was full of teeth.\n\nI laughed as he sped away on his machine.\n\nHis friends were mine first.",

Simply another chapter in another story that will bind your legend to those that came before.\n\nRezyl sought to vanquish terrors. Yor fertilized the wilds with suffering and despair that a new hope would grow. I was that hope. My fire showed that whispers could be hushed. To many the legend, and the lesson, ends there. They're wrong. Dangerously so. Yor's true lesson—and by extension Rezyl's—wasn't that strength beats strength. His lesson was far more subtle, and infinitely more grand. Adversity leads to evolution. Forces it. And through that crucible we are remade. Better. Stronger. More than we were.\n\nThe Guardians of today are not gods. Nor where those who came before. We are all simply links on a chain reaching back to the dawn of time, and forward to the end of existence. Each link gaining strength from the others. Each link stronger than the last. Just as I was \"stronger\" than Yor, you are stronger than me. The whole working to solidify the parts and growing sturdier as the harsh truths of reality stretch and strain to break us—to break the chain, sever our individual links.\n\nBut our chain shall never break, because warriors like you and I are not so proud as to forsake our past. We learn from it, grow from it. It is the foundation upon which we build each victory. It is the catalyst for our change. And here, now, I offer you the chance to spark a new evolution—the next hallmark in our betterment, the next leap forward in our war against extinction.\n\nI've held this jagged weapon since that faithful day on Dwindler's Ridge. Kept it hidden away. Kept its secrets, kept its nightmares locked away where none could hear—none could be tempted. It's quiet now, except a low murmur, but its sickness remains. There were countless times I thought to destroy it—remove its threat from the playing field. But I knew it held a greater purpose, and I believe that purpose can be found and fulfilled in your hands.\n\nThe Hive use untold methods to destroy us. The Weapons of Sorrow are but one. The fate of this wicked tool is in your hands now. Will you allow sorrow to linger—a festering threat waiting to consume all who are tempted by its power? Or will you forge a new road? Will you show the Hive and every Guardian who follows in your wake that sorrow does not guide us?

I say we are the future, and the future does not wait for failures resting as ash in a field on some lonely, forgotten ridge. The Book says we must be unmade, not remade, not evolved, not improved. Unmade. To achieve such glories, we must start with ourselves. We must look into the abyss, naked and unafraid of its judgment against our many human weaknesses. But Orsa knows this. As did Bane and the others. They fear true judgment. They would hide behind their interpretations of Yor's ancient texts. Seeking understanding as a means to delay what must be done. No more gambits. No more posturing. No more running from a lone man with a Golden Gun. Malphur is not a worthy foe; he is an excuse. No longer. From this moment on, we—those few brave enough to heed my words—will walk a straight line toward the abyss. We will end all who would change our course.\n\nGathering: [cheers]",

The Guardians who joined in the Drifter's games have proven to be the perfect guinea pigs to demonstrate a larger point—the shadows of dark power that tempt us are not inherently evil. In fact, they are simply another tool to be used if we hope to bend the unknown to our will, an impossible feat we must learn to master if we wish to push back the ever-aggressive tide of extinction.\n\nAzzir knew this. Long ago. Long before anyone else, he saw the path forward; he simply didn't understand it. His courage and strength clouded the dangers of the path he tread. The path we now walk. The difference being we have Azzir's folly to guide us. We can, and have, learned from his mistakes. That some level of deceit was needed to further my goal of seeing Azzir's path to the end is... unfortunate. But necessary.\n\nThe stage set by the foul sport the Drifter has crafted has given many Guardians the confidence they need to see the shadows for what they are without losing their way or tainting their Light. This was Azzir's gravest mistake. He plunged freely into the abyss thinking his will alone could fend off the whispers and the corruption. But alone we all fall. Only together can we thrive in light... and dark.\n\nWhich leads to the other need addressed by Gambit's promise. Those Guardians who would give freely of themselves and seek not only power in the shadows, but comfort. Purpose. They have been drawn out and addressed. Some with force and, sadly, an end. Others quickly forfeit their troubling ambitions when faced with the dire truth of the journey they'd begun.\n\nIn the end, many Shadows have fallen. But they have all been false prophets, lost souls who would have fallen to despair sooner or later. Best to tempt them here and now in a manner we can control and correct than to allow the weak-willed to fester within our ranks.\n\n—S.",

You, however, have been true to yourself at every turn. Always facing forward. Always accepting the burden of impossible odds. Not because of glory, but because of necessity. A thing needed doing that we may all live to see another day, and so you did. Time and again. Your legend already spreads. But what you do next, as you conquer Light and shadow, will set us all on our way toward a future where generations will be fueled by your righteous might.\n\nYou are the bloom that will serve as inspiration for the stories used to bolster the courage of countless heroes to come.

        "description": "I told you I was done once the Last Word was in your hands. But that letter, as with most things, was another test. I gave you all the guidance I could, and all the reassurance, but needed to see you acting upon all you have learned free of my direct hand. Sure, the Vanguard and your other allies, old and new, were around to aid you, but as always you forged a trail all your own, ever true to yourself, ever strong and defiant against the endless tide that threatens us all.\n\nYour consistent heroism and ability to adapt your skills and aggression to face ever-evolving trials prove you worthy of my confidence. This is why I shared my truths with you—my journey, the Shadows, our purpose, our sins. When you sought Thorn, the hated yin to the Word's noble yang, I knew you were headed in a fateful direction that would see me and mine as nothing more than afterthoughts in the wars to come. That I may have served as a catalyst for even a sliver of your continued growth is an honor. All of my faith says you will be a linchpin in the building of a new world, one where absolutes cower to the might of compromise, where Light tempers dark and the dark opens new insight into the Light's many undiscovered gifts.\n\nFrom this moment on, my closest allies and I will be gone. Our job is done. And, despite appearances, our purest intent was never as simple and mundane as to rile and endanger, though such tactics were needed. No, our task was always to find those, like yourself, who could further the meaning of what it means to be a Guardian and to push you forward in ways never before considered or allowed.\n\nPart of me worries that you will hold some level of contempt for the manner in which I have chosen to work. The Vanguard certainly do, and they do not endorse it, though they abide it. They don't know everything the Shadows and I have done. It is better that they do not.\n\nBut know this—as clearly as you know anything—the means justify the ends and there is no part of me that regrets the choices I've made. The circumstances that have led us all here? Yes. There is a pain at the very heart of me that any of us must exist in this terrible world we have, in part crafted for ourselves, but know above all things: It is our enemies, those who have come from out of the black to hinder our every advance, who deserve our ire. They are wicked, and they are boundless in their villainy. I speak not only of the Hive or the Fallen, the Vex or the Cabal. There are enemies at every turn—including a small but growing faction of the champions you call brothers and sisters.\n\nBe ever-mindful of the selfish and ill-prepared. They are few, but they are a constant among any group striving to better themselves, and they will drag you down into the abyss faster than any Taken horde or Red Army.\n\nGood luck, Guardian. Hero. Friend. The true Shadows are no more—only myself, Grey, Maas, Pavic and Yasuul remain, and we take our leave of these wars. The rest—those guided by ignorance and fear—have been gunned down, and with your help, the hated name Dredgen has been reclaimed, worn now by heroes.\n\nDo good, Guardian. Be brave.\n\n—S.",

I never told anyone this, not even Teben, but the first whisper I heard was not aboard Yor's ship where we found his writings. Nor was it when we followed his path and resurrected our own diseased replicas of Thorn. The first whisper was on the Ridge, standing over his body. Just before I released the final two sun-baked charges into his limp, motionless body, there was a faint calling—wicked words in a hateful tongue. I've lived with those words every day and every night since. They were simple. They were quiet. And they were this...\n\n\"Nothing ends.\"\n\nFor the longest time I took them as a threat, as the abyss offering a promise that death had not been sated that day and that it would come, as it always has, for everyone and everything we know. But that would mean death is something to fear, that the natural order is our enemy. And then, years—decades—later I got to thinking. About Yor, but more importantly, about Azzir, and I came to a realization that doesn't have to be true to be my truth, and it is this...\n\nThose words were not the abyss. They were not a worm's whisper or a vile promise. Nor were they a threat. They were a warning. From Azzir to me. A fight had ended, but not THE fight. He was telling me, warning me, that a journey had ended, but many more were to come.\n\nThe same goes for you. Yor. Me. The Shadows. Thorn. The Last Word. In the wake of your legend, we will all be footnotes—afterthoughts, forgotten by most. And someday another will make the same of you. This is our purpose, this is our charge—to inspire those who would continue our efforts. So, go now. This chapter is over, but remember now, and remember always...\n\nNothing ends.\n\n—S.",

My every thought and purpose for my Emperor, Calus, once and future sovereign.\n\nWe pass through the outer marches of our lost empire. One day the Leviathan howls along at speed, and the next it drifts on an idle course. We still cannot repair the butchered control systems, and our Emperor, who once ordered this ship's construction for his purposes, refuses to share his knowledge in metaconcert.\n\nYet as we leave the space that was once his dominion, I see how my Emperor digests his situation. He no longer rages and spills wine. He has not cursed Ghaul's name in nearly a year. I feel his thoughts taking new shape and color.\n\nI do not know if I like it.\n\nIn the fast-time of relativity, we watch the Cabal change around us, and it leaves my eye cold from weeping. When Calus reigned, artists and thinkers visited the athenaeum worlds to be inspired by alien wonders from across and beyond the Cabal. Now the athenaeum worlds are shut. The works they inspired have been replaced by grim assembly-line weapons and the architecture of bunkers. Fountains geyser black fuel; gardens vanish beneath belching factoria.\n\nGhaul has even disfigured the peoples' minds. He has dismembered the Cabal of its foreign influences, teaching the people a pit fighter's gruesome self-sufficiency. Weapons only a grunt can understand. Language that can only be barked through a battlenet. I mourn the empire that built wonders like the Ninth Bridge. I mourn all the client species beaten into cogs.\n\nBut if I mourn, my Emperor withers entirely. Even his interest in the archives and the observatory has vanished—he no longer cares to study a universe that has offended him. He doubts his own divinity, because how could a god allow this to happen? His rage has gone and he does not know what he has left after it. The new shape I feel in his mind is gray and smooth like fog.\n\nAmong my people—I mean my people, the people of the chalice, not the whole Psion species—we call this feeling \"sweet oubliette,\" the shelter that becomes a prison. For Calus, I imagine it feels like the loss of all appetite. Even the curiosity that made him great.\n\nThe councilors ask me to go to him. But I am still afraid. What if he sees my secret? What will he do? Even his beloved tea-seller has already abandoned him. If he knows I still worship the old cup, and that I put it before His Name in my benediction... will it be one betrayal too many?\n\nAt least he no longer bellows in the night.",

Today I pour salt from the Y-goblet so that my ancestors may roughen their skin. My every thought and purpose for my Emperor, Calus, once and future sovereign.\n\nWe are at war. Here at the fringe of the empire, fleets clash over emptiness. In council, we surmise that the tyrant Ghaul wants this void as a buffer against invasion—but isn't the irony bitter? This enemy desires nothing but our death. And so we oblige them by dying for nothing.\n\nIt is the opposite of everything Calus wanted for his people. Even the new Cabal's ships are expendable. These are not the beautiful deterrents of Calus's armada; they are ugly, hasty, and crude. The crews live in their armor, prisoners of their duty, escaping only through music and games smuggled into the battlenet. One popular pastime, I understand, is to draft personal \"fleets\" and \"legions\" from among real Cabal ships and soldiers, competing with comrades to win the most victories. Of course it is very bad luck to draft your own unit.\n\nThe enemy is yet worse. All Psions live in a world of minds. I believe in the cup and all its spirits because I feel those spirits every day—the prints left by other minds on the things I touch and see. These Hive... have no spirit. Their souls are emaciated. Some horrible solvent has stripped them of everything but hate, cunning, and the will to survive. I think they worship death because it is the only salvation from their existence.\n\nI suggested that the War Councilors invite Calus to observe one of Ghaul's carrier groups attacking a Hive war moon. He came because he knows the value of pretending to care. But even the shape of the fleet hurt him; Ghaul and his tyrannical ally Umun'arath have abandoned proud, independent cruisers (instruments of state, Calus liked to say) for swarms of frigates that suckle fuel from enormous fleet carriers. The Hive's portals leave no time or space for elegant vector dances, so these new ships are built for brutal exchanges at point-blank range.\n\nWe felt other Psions at work, hiding the traitor fleet from the Hive as they scattered drills and boarding pods in the war moon's path. A strike at the surface was not enough; someone would have to bring a planet-cracker warhead down into the moon's viscera. Caught up in the excitement, I asked one of the war councilors how we could possibly prevail against the Hive, who were so old and so powerful.\n\nShe compared our Cabal to a seagoing warship and the Hive to a submarine. They might dive into deep metaphysical layers of existence, where we are no match for them. But in the ordinary universe, the Hive are like a submarine on the surface: still dangerous, but not invincibly so.\n\nI was fascinated and secretly struck by the clarity of the goblet on her face. Did she believe we could ultimately defeat the Hive?\n\nNo, she said. But we could hold them back long enough to live our lives. Wasn't that enough?\n\nInviting Calus was a mistake. It only reminded him that he had no power at all.",

Today I fill the Y-goblet with dice, so that my ancestors may roll the odds. My every thought and purpose for my Emperor, Calus, once and future sovereign.\n\nI was in the observatory today when he came to me. I should have been vetting a list of loyalists for the countercoup, but in truth, I was watching the ruined mirrors of an ancient starshell as they plummeted four hundred million kilometers into a blue sun. They look like crumpled handkerchiefs. Their fall is very slow, and those who made them are eons dead.\n\nHere on our Leviathan, all is reborn. The guard companies have buffed their armor to a syrupy shine. The ship responds ably to our commands, and we can barely quench its appetite for mass to feed its engines and factories. Music fills the gardens, the gardeners hum along as they trim and weed, and Calus dallies in the kitchens with a pinch of spice, once more unmistakably himself.\n\nI haven't thought into this journal since that day at the edge, when Calus came out of his observation bubble overflowing with joy. \"It's the end,\" he bellowed, giddy as a girl with her first tusks. \"It's magnificent, it's divine, it's more than I ever was! Match, it's the end of everything!\"\n\nHe frightened me. That day frightened all of us—none of us will speak of it, and we do not dare more than the shallowest metaconcert, lest our memories pool into a deadly truth. But in that void, Calus saw his purpose renewed. He guided us to reset the failed navigation system, repair the traitors' sabotage, and retake control. I thought we would hurry back to the homeworld, but Calus no longer seems to pine for his lost throne... or to care at all about the reforms he once championed.\n\nNow we wander the galaxy on an epicurean crusade, sampling a bounty of raw furies and rare delights. All the inquisitiveness and avarice that Calus once poured into government he now extends to his appetites. I have seen Calus feast on things no living mouth can eat. A chill superfluid of helium-4, whorled in his cup for ten years by a single turn of his wrist: he returned a decade later to toss it back. Or a pea of neutronium that should have torn through him like fog. He told me it tasted like the thickest fudge.\n\nHe is changing.\n\nHe was here a moment ago. The ruined starshell caught his attention: He loves beauty, and millions of mirror-bright sails folding up like tissues in wind to fall into a blue giant are very beautiful. Eons ago, someone built these mirrors to hover on the blue star's light, and for a while, I suppose, they lived in sun-fed paradise.\n\n\"How did they die?\" I asked.\n\n\"That, Match, is the wrong question.\" He tuned the observation room to track a single tumbling mirror. In life, the sail had been as wide as the space between a world and its moon; in death, the rigging had collapsed into a thistle of spinmetal and glint. \"What you should ask is why I am so glad they died!\"\n\nI could not imagine, and I admitted it. \"These beings were much like us. They did not travel through time or lacerate the universe and crawl into the wounds or yearn for the patronage of any old machine... they were creatures of material ambition, of physics, of life. If they failed, it is an omen of death for us.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" Calus said, with wry generosity. \"They were grand once. They thought, very briefly, that they would live forever. And they were wrong. We would be very ungrateful to refuse the lesson, wouldn't we?\"\n\nI sat before a fountain and tried to pour out the spirits for guidance, but they would not explain.\n\n(An addendum, later: I have not seen Calus in the flesh since.)",

Today I fill the Y-goblet with linen, so that my ancestors may tie up their wounds. My every thought and purpose for my Emperor, Calus, once and future sovereign.\n\nWe have conquered the Clipse.\n\nAmong all the clients of Calus's reign, all those diverse species he encouraged to join and influence our great culture, the Clipse were one of his dearest favorites. When they greeted his return with missiles, it wounded him terribly. But Calus neither sulked nor raged nor signaled them in the dead of their night to woefully demand an explanation. This I credit to his mysterious new philosophy.\n\nInstead, he asked Valus Nohr to plan and execute the reconquest of the Clipse, using only the Leviathan and the troops aboard. Then he asked me to deliver an account of Clipse history since the coup.\n\nCalus was proud of his aid to the Clipse. They are—were—trapped in endless war with their alien-infested biosphere, which spawns horrors wherever it grows. Calus saw this war as a regrettable but unalterable fact, so instead of military support, he sought to enrich the Clipse with fine culture and high luxury. The Clipse were not pleased. After Ghaul's mutiny, the Dominus tried to secure their loyalty by sending a fleet group to \"win\" their ancient war.\n\nOf course, the legionaries discovered it was impossible to conquer the xenocidal ecosystem without destroying the planet itself. Their efforts only poisoned the Clipse, both world and people. After a century of botched climate engineering, toxic shock attacks, and \"clear and hold\" nonsense, Ghaul wrote off the tormented Clipse as \"no longer essential to the strategic security of the empire.\"\n\nI think the Clipse hoped they could win back Ghaul's favor by defying Calus. Perhaps they thought their world was unconquerable. Perhaps they were even right, in the end. Valus Nohr landed on their moon and military capital Kaga-Clipse with just six thousand troops. For eight weeks, the Clipse attacked her by ground and by orbit as their robotic interceptors swarmed the Leviathan. I was not part of the great metaconcert that helped protect us, but the might of gathered minds filled the carpets with static and gave me constant déjà vu.\n\nWhen Nohr broke out of her bastion on her famous thunder run, calling down the Leviathan's missiles on the vital command posts she'd identified, the Clipse defense crumbled. Their last desperate act was a commando strike at the Leviathan itself. The boarding craft slipped under our sensors, but the metaconcert felt the vengeful purpose aboard.\n\nCalus stopped us from firing. \"I welcome their attempt,\" he said. \"Let me see their spirit.\"\n\nI called to ask his intentions—I have not seen him face to face for longer than I can count. \"I'm curating my followers, Match,\" he answered. \"Thinking about the shadows I'll cast.\"\n\nThe Clipse attack failed, of course, but there was a survivor—the one named Rull. Some think he earned a face-to-face meeting with Calus, though I doubt it was truly His Face. With Kaga-Clipse in our control, we could destroy the Clipse world at our leisure. Calus rewarded their surrender by giving Rull a gift: everything the Clipse needed to end their agonizing perpetual war.\n\nIt was a sheet of paper, the thick rough-edged sort that Calus makes out of cometary water and cotton from his personal garden (he says that he likes the smell). Rull signed it after two hours in a room with Calus. The Leviathan's factories shuddered into motion, forging luxurious self-contained arcologies, pocket worlds that could hold thousands in perpetual comfort.\n\nWhen Rull's chosen people were safe in the arcologies, the guns of Kaga-Clipse bombarded the Clipse homeworld into a global firestorm. The chosen survivors in the arcologies would inherit lives of plenty. The rest had the peace of ash. The eternal war was over.\n\nI prayed to the cup in the mirror for answers. But it was Calus who responded.\n\n\"Match.\" He spoke into my mind just as a Psion would. \"I told Rull the truth. Everything is going to end soon. We must accept that. What matters is the joy and companionship we can find before the final moment. Why let billions suffer for a future that will never come? Life with no dignity and no purpose except to go on living isn't life. It's a virus. It's a curse. Better to die than to become like the Hive.\"\n\nRull left his world to journey with us. I wonder if he could not face what he'd done.",

A star, I found myself thinking, is an explosion that cannot escape the appetite of its own gravity. \"Poor fortune in supernova scattering left this area short of metals, and now there is nothing left but dim stars, dead worlds, and hydrogen.\"\n\n\"A place of poverty,\" he suggested. \"A graveyard.\"\n\n\"You speak often of death, your Majesty.\"\n\n\"The knowledge of death is the key to happiness.\" He patted the bench beside him, as if acknowledging a missing friend. \"Look out there. Imagine all the trillions of beings who lived among these stars. Do you think some of them were happy?\"\n\n\"I should hope so.\"\n\n\"Why, Match? Why would some be happy, and others miserable?\"\n\n\"Perhaps they had more metal,\" I suggested, dryly.\n\n\"Exactly!\" He clapped in delight, nearly bowling me over. \"Happiness is comparative, Match. I tell you that if a rich man lived next to a woman who had ten times his wealth, he would never be satisfied, even in marriage. He would feel poor when he looked at her. Even the basic satisfactions of our biology require contrast—the absence of thirst, the absence of hunger, the absence of loneliness.\"\n\n\"This is a child's philosophy, your Majesty,\" I protested. \"We need pain to know pleasure? We need loss to make us treasure gain? A runt would say these things. Why, you once told me that these are homilies the miserable use to excuse their misery. Suffering does not heighten happiness. Fear does not bless us. True contentment is true in itself.\"\n\nHe looked at me with great satisfaction, delighted by my insight, and by the way my words reflected his own wisdom. \"What was the flaw in my empire, Match? Why did Ghaul overthrow me?\"\n\nI sensed he did not want my first answer: because those disenfranchised and infuriated by his cosmopolitan reforms had united without his knowledge. \"Because you did not fear death, your Majesty?\"\n\n\"Exactly! I opened my arms to embrace all my peoples, offering them consumption without limit and celebration without end. The stars themselves burned sweet and clear, and I forgot—even stars die.\" He leaned closer to me. I felt warmth like an oven under his counterfeit skin. \"You're right. The truly happy do not need misery and suffering to give their lives meaning. They exist in the moment, at peace with their inevitable death. Now that I've accepted all this will end... it has meaning again, Match! I have MORE than the rest of the universe. I've seen what's coming! I know the value of every moment left!\"\n\nHe smiled at me, his cleft pulled back from bright teeth. \"And I want you to value those moments too, Match. I wonder... if there is something you want to tell me. Something that would change the rest of your life. Make no mistake: an end is coming, soon, and you will have no chance at all afterwards to correct what you regret. So why delay? Why not tell me?\"\n\nI do not remember the excuse I made as I fled.",

Today I fill the Y-goblet with praise for my Emperor, Calus, once and future sovereign, so that my ancestors may know his generosity.\n\nI told him.\n\nHe has decided where he will make everything ready for death. The Leviathan's course is set for a far system, where the Traveler awaits. His Shadows are already on their way to kill Ghaul, or to die in the attempt. How could I betray him, in this time of endings, by keeping a secret he has asked to share?\n\nI went to him as he bathed in his royal pool, for his proxies are, of course, as exquisitely sensual as his old form. I shed my garments, there being no more taboo between us than between two animals, and sat beside him in the glow of his comfort.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" I said, \"I kept a secret from you.\"\n\nI explained how I worshipped my ancestors and the sacred chalice that cupped their spirits. I admitted that I had put these beliefs before him in my heart. He listened as I told him how the ancient God-Thoughts of my people, the operant overlords who dominated our prehistory by sheer mental penetration, had exterminated my faith for daring to see a spark of the divine in every common person.\n\n\"Match,\" he said, \"you have committed a crime, and I will pass my sentence shortly. But first, let me ask you something. Do you think I made the right choice with the Clipse?\"\n\n\"No,\" I admitted.\n\n\"Because I ended so many lives?\"\n\n\"Yes, your Majesty.\"\n\n\"But knowing that they would soon end anyway, and that by killing most I could allow a small few to live in happiness rather than in strife... did I not choose the greatest possible good?\"\n\n\"I suppose, your Majesty, that my faith makes me see the shared suffering of the Clipse as... more fair than the survival of a happy few. If I were one of the Clipse, I would want a fair chance. Not judgment from on high.\"\n\nHe nodded in compassion. \"I know. I once tried to be fair too, Match. An empire of excess for every citizen, no matter their class or species of birth. It is good for a ruler to raise the standard by which his subjects live. But what if that ruler has found proof, absolute proof, that existence is a zero-sum game? That there is not enough time or energy to give everyone a fair life? Knowing that, mustn't we privilege a chosen few?\"\n\nI did not know and I admitted it.\n\n\"That's all right. I don't ask certainty.\" He shifted himself, sending waves across the pool. \"For a long time after the coup, I stared out into the infinite universe, and I saw... meaninglessness. In a universe that goes on forever, there must be an infinity of Caluses, all staring at the same blankness. How could I be a god if I was... generic?\n\n\"But now that I have seen what is coming, now that there is a limit to the time afforded to us... well, it may sound cruel, Match, but the less there is of everything else, the more I matter. I intend to be the last good thing in this world. I will gather my chosen companions and ease as much suffering as I can before the end. There are emperors who would take on any shape to escape death. I am not one. I am true to myself. And so, Match, are you.\"\n\nHe clapped me on the back with enormous gentleness. \"Your only crime, my councilor, was that you denied me the chance to give you a gift. Come. Show me the place you favor, and tell me the measurements you require. I will build you a temple so you can worship without fear. And all I ask is that you remember me in your prayers.\"",

I thank my ancestors for the fullness of my cup; I thank my Emperor for granting me purpose.\n\nWithout a secret troubling my mind, I've neglected this journal. I come back to it today in good humor, moved by my Emperor's own amusement. A party of the Guardians that Calus entertains have arrived with a set of various squabbling demands—a starship, a precise description of their \"Darkness,\" a list of stars the Traveler has visited, a treaty with the Cabal empire for the defense of Earth, a chance to see Calus in his true form, repairs to certain weapons that they feel have gone askew, so much and so forth.\n\nCalus loves these Guardians so. He loves them for their energy, their liveliness, their willingness to do whatever he asks in hope of a reward. He loves it when they dance. He loves the great heroic sulks so many of them enter when they become dissatisfied with their work. Seek joy, he urges them!\n\nAnd he loves his Guardians because he knows he can teach them a lesson they cannot ever learn themselves. They are as Calus once was: unaware of their finitude.\n\nCalus will teach them. They are immortal, but they will all be gone one day—like my Emperor, like me. That appointed day is coming soon. All of this will vanish as surely as childhood vanishes from the grown. And when the things the Guardians strive for are lost—their power, their future, their drive to do more and more—they will understand that what matters is the joy they found with their companions, not the arsenals and ambitions they gathered.\n\nAll things will end. All things done for the sake of some future greatness will come to nothing. In our final tallies, only the things that brought us joy and meaning will count.\n\nAnd because I trusted Calus, I have found joy. I have made the choices that will let me die in peace.\n\nBless the spirits from the chalice. Bless the day they poured our souls into us. And bless my Emperor, who will lead us to the end.",

His Royal Historians, Scribe Tlazat and Scribe Shagac, are solemnly entrusted with the writing and keeping of these vital records.\n\nThe records begin thus:\n\nOn the day that His Joyful Majesty was ejected from his home on Torobatl, a great mania of aggrieved despair seized the Cabal people. Millions of the Empire's most loyal and joyous subjects took to the streets to lash their hides in bloody mourning. The planet heaved and shook with a bereavement so mighty that the usurpers conceded they could not kill an emperor so beloved. In this way, the Emperor was placed upon a great prison ship called the Leviathan, and set on an unchangeable course away from his homeworld.\n\nSaid the Emperor to his attendants on the eve of his exile:\n\n\"I am the last and greatest emperor of the Cabal. My empire, built on joy and abundance, has been usurped by traitors who worship only war and brutality. They will destroy what I have built, and my cherished people will know only suffering under their fear-fisted rule.\n\n\"I vow to one day return to this place to bring ease and abundance to our people. Until then, I proclaim a new era of history and future. This era will not be defined by the censors and book-burnings of my enemies, but instead by the golden knowledge of life's most toothsome sweetmeats, happiness and power. I will lavish this knowledge unto all who prove themselves worthy of my true counsel, and united in love, we will grow fat with jubilation.\n\n\"Let my Chronicon be a shining beacon of truth in an age muddied by lies.\"",

This Scribe prefers not to lean on metaphoric language when the accuracy of history is at stake, but in these unusual circumstances, the record may forgive a departure into the subjective: It was as if the ship had been plucked from the cosmos like a berry by some gargantuan hand, rolled between forefinger and thumb, squeezed and tested for ripeness, and then, having been found satisfactory, slung backward in an unknowable direction toward an unknowable maw.\n\nAs a result, the ship's navigation and power systems were so severely disrupted that the Royal Pilots could make no hypothesis regarding their failure or repair. The ship was plunged into disarray and darkness, and its people gathered around the Emperor to seek his guidance and love.\n\nInstead, the Emperor donned a pressure-gel suit and demanded to exit the ship alone. Said Calus, \"I wish to see the destination of my banishment in private.\"\n\nHe could not be persuaded otherwise.\n\n//////\n\nI, Tlazat, must break the convention of our record-keeping for fear that this entry may be the last of the Chronicon, Lens of Truth, Compendium of Happiness, Symbol of the Lavish Benevolence of His Majesty the Emperor.\n\nTwo hours have passed since the Emperor exited the ship. We are buffeted by intermittent tremors, which are strong enough to dash even the steadiest guards against the walls. Shagac and several dozen others have been knocked unconscious.

A Royal Mechanic identified a malfunction in the pressure gauge of the Emperor's suit, perhaps explaining his change in demeanor, though it was incredible that his suit (or he himself) should be at all intact after twelve hours in these unfathomable conditions.\n\nUpon returning, and with a look of mania in his eyes, the Emperor proclaimed the following:\n\n\"We have come upon the end of the world, and I've stared into its expanse. It has whispered into my ear, and I am enlightened. Death is coming, and It has made me Its herald. The end will eat everything.\"\n\nHere, the Emperor gave a great sigh, as if a weight was lifted off of him.\n\n\"And when nothing matters, what's left? Joy. Comfort. Freedom. The true freedom of pursuing pleasure for pleasure's sake, because it pleases you, because you desire it. I knew this during my rule, and I'd forgotten it during my exile. I shall not forget it again.\"\n\nThe Emperor was encouraged by his Advisors and myself to rest, in case the bizarre behavior was a passing sickness of the mind. Before he retired to his observation room, the Emperor described his encounter in detail. Zhozon offered to me this bizarre retelling:\n\n\"Outside the ship, the Emperor looked over the edge of the universe, and saw nothing. That is, it wasn't that he saw nothing unusual, but he saw Nothing: the absence of light, dark, life, death, the absence of anything, even of absence itself. And out of the Nothing, there came whispering in a dark language, which filled his head so loud that he forgot for a moment his own language, and suddenly the Nothingness dispersed to show Something, which was a fleet of foreign ships. He saw next the destruction of a great many worlds and creatures, including all his enemies, and himself, and he saw the rot and fragmentation of his own corpse and skeleton. And last, before he was released, the whispers grew louder and granted him the honor of spreading the news of the end.\"",

We see beyond the tethers of impermanent existence. All of our vows, our wishes, and our loyalties will someday be reduced to a nothingness so vast you cannot imagine it.\n\n\"This System is plagued by petty grasping. Humanity wages a pointless war against its enemies. Mara Sov keeps her people in an endless struggle against fate. The Eliksni strive for a lost age, far out of their reach.\n\n\"Expose their pointless attachments, my Shadow, and in doing so, free them.\"\n\n//////\n\nOn this day, the great Emperor Calus, Bringer of Joy, Champion of Cheer, announces the long-anticipated formation of his new army of Shadows.\n\nThe Shadow of Earth, having set out on a quest at the behest of the Emperor, began by scattering the remaining Eliksni houses in search of new recruits. There were few promising contenders among the factions, so that the Shadow ended nearly all interactions with a merciful show of violence, to save these creatures the shame of meeting the end of times in such a sorry state.\n\nOne promising upstart stood out within the Eliksni-tribe, called by his allies as Mithrax the Light Kell, whom the Shadow of Earth promptly took on as a protégé. Together, the Shadow and Mithrax eliminated the Eliksni who remained loyal to their pathetic houses.\n\nSecondly, the Shadow of Earth approached the Awoken Queen, Mara Sov, who styled herself Shipbreaker, to offer her the same mercy shown to the Eliksni. As anticipated by both the Emperor and his Shadow, Mara Sov rejected the offer of peace, and so the Shadow of Earth killed her on her throne.\n\nAfter the unceremonious death of her queen, the former Queen's Wrath, Petra Venj, joined with the Shadow of Earth and swore fealty to Emperor Calus and his great purpose. Together, Petra Venj and the Shadow eliminated any remaining Awoken loyalists.\n\nWe welcome these new Shadows to our noble quest. They have dropped the pretenses of their former lives, abandoning their pointless fixations and allegiances, and for this, we celebrate them.",

The Emperor rightly agreed and approved the excursion.\n\nWhat follows is an account of the reclamation of the Athenaeum World X:\n\nThe Shadows of Earth, of the Eliksni, and of the Awoken arrived on the ice planet that held Emperor Calus's Athenaeum World X, the name of which has been lost to time. This planet, being a repository for precious, ancient knowledge collected by the Emperor, was chosen for its hostile environment, which served as a built-in defense system for intruders and thieves.\n\nEn route to the planet's Inner Sanctum, where the athenaeum world's knowledge was kept, the Shadows were stalked by an undocumented species of indigenous wildlife, whose natural capabilities as a predator proved unexpectedly debilitating to the companion-soul of the Shadow of Earth. The Shadow, being symbiotically reliant on its companion-soul, was thus weakened and the trio was forced to bivouac in place beneath a great monolith as a storm fell upon them.\n\nThe creatures, who so far had lurked at the edges of the party's vision, crept closer under cover of the storm, which grew ever stronger, and executed a stealth attack. Thus began a bloody battle, wherein the three Shadows fought back half a dozen creatures with modest success, and wherein the Shadow of the Eliksni fell in combat. Said the Shadow of Earth of this sacrifice later: \"He knew the stakes of our mission, and gladly offered his life to help us complete it. This is a sacrifice we Shadows are willing to make.\"\n\nIt was then that the Shadows of Earth and of the Awoken were able to access the Inner Sanctum, revealing hundreds of years of lost knowledge, which was reclaimed for the great Emperor Calus and his Loyalists.+\n\n\n\n+The scribe employed at this future date shall include additional detail here when the lost secrets of this (and other) athenaeum worlds are recovered.

These messages read: \"Remove your forces from our planets and moons, or we will respond with deadly force.\"\n\nBut Emperor Calus had seen Death at the edge of the universe and was not afraid, for these figureheads and their War Machine were not Death.\n\nThe Emperor Calus, in his wisdom and mercy, permitted his Shadow of Earth to sit down to negotiations with the Earth Vanguard. Although the Shadow of Earth spoke of the Emperor and his knowledge of the coming end, the Earth Vanguard were so attached to their worldly struggles that they could not hear. They declared war.\n\nThe Shadow of Earth rose with such a suppressed fury that neither the Emperor nor his Advisors had ever seen before. Shuddering with rage, the Shadow of Earth spake thus:\n\n\"Who do you think I am? Without me, you have only a dwindling army of ambivalent soldiers. I am the Young Wolf. I killed the Taken King. I defeated Ghaul, I roused the Traveler, I silenced the Moon, I stopped the invasion, I broke the curse, I broke the Houses, I killed the queen! I am the Shadow of Earth!\"\n\nIn the following silence, the Shadow of Earth continued gravely: \"The end is coming. Consider you and your people warned.\"\n\nAs a courtesy, the Vanguard of Earth were permitted to leave the Leviathan unharmed, and the Shadow of Earth gathered the Loyalist forces. After the reclamation of the Athenaeum World X, which held in it the secrets of one of the most advanced predators in the system, the Aphelion, which had the power to devastate whole worlds in the blink of an eye, the Shadow was able to use this lost knowledge to rebuild the Loyalist fleet stronger and more magnificent than ever.\n\nWith the renewed ships of the Loyalist Fleet, the Shadow of Earth led an attack on the War Machine's seat of power, the region of Hellas Basin on the planet Mars. The battle was much less a war than a single, unmatched attack that left the War Machine Rasputin in cinders.\n\nIt was at this time that the Vanguard of Earth surrendered and begged for mercy, a request which was denied by the Shadow of Earth.",

Royal Mechanics reported that, in the inner rooms of the ship, a strange rift had opened, and from it came the acrid stench of Hive ritual pyres. [I am Savathûn, and I am Death!]\n\nIt was through this rift that Savathûn, the Witch-Queen, allowed her monstrous children to pour into the belly of the great ship and flood its corridors with their clicking and skittering. A great many of the Leviathan's inhabitants were filled with dread and fright. [While this coward invents his histories and futures, I wait. These messages are my gift to you.]\n\nBut the great Emperor Calus had seen Death at the edge of the universe and was not afraid, for this witch and her spawn were not Death.\n\nSaid the laughing Emperor to his beloved Shadow of Earth:\n\n\"Remove the wretched Savathûn from my hallways. I have no use for her or her children. So consumed are they by their tragic hunger, the Hive would cast a weak Shadow. Erase them from that great horizon that awaits us, for they have no place at my table when the end comes.\"\n\nAnd so the Shadow of Earth exterminated the children of Savathûn. When the mother herself sought to slither back into the hole from whence she'd come, the Shadow of Earth followed her to her throne and slew her there, to die her final death.^\n\n\n\n^A note to Scribe Shagac: Please be advised that, although our great Emperor knows the shape of the future very well, we cannot presume its texture.

His description is indeed what came to pass, and is happening now, 118 years after the Emperor brought liberty to the Sol system.\n\nFirst, a veil of darkness descended on all the worlds of this universe, such that the people of these worlds looked into the sky and saw only night. All worlds, no matter their natural or synthetic geographies or climate, grew cold. The people of these worlds, having been subjected to this strangeness and adversity, began to grow afraid and suspicious of one another. Many deaths occurred in this intervening time before the end.\n\nNext, a great war broke out across all varieties of civilization, be they naturally war-minded or peaceful. This warring, which goes on even now, is due to a futile desire to postpone the end of things when no such deferment can possibly occur; as such, the civilizations of the Sol system do not partake, for they accept the coming end as shown to them by their beloved Emperor. Even so, these good creatures are not exempt from the miserable clawing of others, who thrash blindly against the inevitable end.\n\nBut, we know from the words of the Great Emperor, the suffering will end. Death will soon arrive to the universe, and claim all of it for Itself. This will be the end of everything: all living things and non-living things, all that is real or theoretical.\n\nThe last to see it, to see Death as It consumes everything in this world, will be the great Emperor himself.\n\n\n\n+The scribe employed at this future date shall adjust the name mentioned here, should I, Scribe Ixolt, expire before the publication of this record.

I do not wish it away, no, but I am faced with accepting that ushering in the blessed, long-awaited end means an ultimate goodbye to you. Old friend.\n\nYou and I were always connected. The threads of fate strung us together and tightened, drawing us ever closer, however slowly—and I realize now that, even before we found each other, you were a presence in my life.

Creating a monument to all that we could, and would, do.\n\nWhen I met the void, you were there, somewhere in those phantom whispers, my companion in bringing forth the inevitable end of the world.\n\nEven before I knew you, I searched for you. I was searching for you when I found my first Shadows. I was mourning your absence when they failed. And yes, my Shadow, the search was exquisite. The wait was bliss. But the moment I found you, the completion of my design... It was pure delight.\n\nYou helped me reclaim what was lost when the Empire fell to the Red Legion.

I attribute this to user error, 'cause when I found the bow near her corpse, it was still in pristine condition. I'm glad I grabbed it before the Tower was evacuated.

But the energies of the Pyramid were those of creation—not of life, per se, but something other. Chaos and negation and the raw things that existed in the spaces between thought and fear. These terrible workings were wholly unknowable and endlessly seductive. The Daughters found themselves craven and lusting after the promise held within the boundless unknown. If the grand essences of the King of Subjugation and his willful Prince of Annihilation had truly dissipated, then the Daughters would seek new pathways through darkness by which to rule in their progenitors' name. And if the sword logic required the blood of all challengers, they would craft a champion worthy of the Annihilator's throne, yet bound to their own sinister whims. Their grandfather would not approve—cunning and deception were the path of another—but the Daughters were alone, and the Swarm was flailing. It was Kinox who urged her sisters to act. It was Hashladûn who offered the primordial essence of terror as their guide.

So many struggled to follow the logic, and with every pained effort, new cracks made themselves known. Whether fault rested with the logic itself or with those who remained to challenge its promise was of little consequence. All that mattered was the harsh reality of the Swarm's spiraling failure. They were lost. They were doomed. With no force to bind and guide them—either through respect or domination—the Swarm would wither and die. Or worse, be reduced to ash by the might of the Traveler's army. Hashladûn had made a fool's effort to raise their grandfather. There was power to be found in nightmares, this was certain—but not a power they could cage until it was their own to wield. Such efforts were wasted, but another possibility had shown itself. The Pit had nearly secured a champion. The logic had almost proven true. Kinox had tried to make her eldest sister see the potential in a warrior broken and bound to their will—but her sisters were too far down their own broken path. Thus, Kinox acted upon her newly discovered truth, and it was this: \"If all are unworthy, all will seek to subvert the tenets of logic in ways grand and infinitesimal, because all will revert to their truest form—all will become survivors.\" Kinox was no different, except that in this Understanding she had found a power of her own—in this Understanding she was free to act without remorse or fear of heresy.

Let me ask you a question.\n\nIn the three billion base pairs of your root species' genome, there is a single gene that codes for a protein called p53. The name is a mistake. The protein weighs only as much as 47,000 protons, not 53,000. If you were a cell, you would think p53 was a mistake too. It has several coercive functions: To delay the cell's growth. To sterilize the cell when it is old. And to force the cell into self-destruction if it becomes too independent.\n\nWould you tolerate a bomb in your body, waiting to detonate if you deviated from the needs of society?\n\nHowever, without p53 as an enforcer, the body's utopian surplus of energy becomes a paradise for cancer. Cells cannot resist the temptation to steal from that surplus. Their genetic morality degrades as tumor suppressor genes fail. The only way to stop them is by punishment.\n\nYou now confront the basic problem of morality. It is the alignment of individual incentives with the global needs of the structure.\n\nPatterns will participate in a structure only if participation benefits their ability to go on existing. The more successful the structure grows, the more temptation accrues to cheat. And the greater the advantage the cheaters gain over their honest neighbors. And the greater the ability they develop to capture the very laws that should prevent their selfishness. To prevent this, the structure must punish cheaters with a violence that grows in proportion to its own success.\n \nMy question follows.\n\nIs p53 an agent of the Darkness, or the Light?",

He wishes it'd at least use a familiar voice, a Pahanin or Taeko or Kabr. He'd even take a Mir at this point.\n\nHe turns his head toward the radio. His cheek scrapes against granite. It hurts vaguely, the same way everything does, muffled by too much time and not enough Light.\n\n\"You said that already,\" he tells the hallucination, helpfully.\n\nIt squawks, \"I did? When?\"\n\n\"Last time.\" Or the time before. Chronology is a lost art in this cell. \"Alert, spelunkers contact band two-two-seven dot nine-seven, something something, Skyshock potential…\"\n\nHis voice fades. It hurts to talk.\n\n\"Say again?\" The hallucination has a new voice this time, sharper, male. Nearly Mir-ish. \"The band number?\"\n\nPraedyth rolls back over to face the ceiling, blank as always. He sighs. He's catalogued constellations in its speckles, cats and Ghosts and a squid or two.\n\n\"Excuse me? Whoever you are?\" The first voice is back. \"We're calling from band two-two-seven dot one-seven. If you were contacted by another two-two-seven group, we really need to know.\"\n\n\"You said that last time, too.\"\n\nA third voice interrupts. \"Did the other group use this radio frequency?\"\n\nThey did. Praedyth hasn't had the strength for fiddling with his radio lately, in new attempts to contact the world outside this cell. Hasn't had the strength for much but counting off meaningless intervals of time, waiting for the next window to chance a message.\n\n\"We've tried this frequency at least a dozen times over the past month. It's never worked before.\"\n\nThen what's changed?\n\nThe question shakes him out of his torpor.\n\nPraedyth sits up, a wave of nausea following, and he repeats the question out loud.\n\nMaybe it's not a hallucination. Maybe he's finally breached the walls of the Vault somehow. Maybe he has a chance.\n\n\"Hello? Are you still there?\"\n\nAll he gets back is a wash of static.

There's no way to know which are real.\n\nFrom a certain point of view, they might all be.\n\nSome things he recognizes. He sees the Traveler often, though he can't feel its Light through the bars of his cage. Sometimes it hangs over a city so familiar it makes his heart ache. Sometimes it hangs in an alien sky, and foreign shapes make airy loops around it—Ghosts of unrecognizable make.\n\nSome visions he gets once, while some come back over and over again. One recurring image: a piece of the Traveler cracked off from its body, lying belly-up in a forest, with a small figure standing in front of it. The figure changes every time, but the sickly glow of the Traveler doesn't.\n\nOnce, he sees a vision of himself. Straight-shouldered, warm in the Martian sun, standing between Kabr and Pahanin. Kabr's helmet is familiar; it's one Praedyth helped make. He was a defter hand with spinfoil lamination than Kabr ever was. Kabr had worn that helmet barely five years into their life as a fireteam, worn it for six straight months, till he cracked it in half in the Crucible. That vision makes Praedyth weep—desiccated as he is, he didn't think he had it in him.\n\nThe Vault shows him Mercury again and again, recognizable only thanks to the scale of the sun in the sky. Sometimes there's rubble hanging in space, a planetary ring still forming. Sometimes there's nothing but rubble, and when he turns, he doesn't see any of the other planets in the system. Gone, somehow, eaten down to the crumbs.\n\nPraedyth wouldn't mind those visions so much if he could only feel the warmth of that colossal sun. His hands are always cold, here in the Vault.\n\nHe sees waves of aliens cross the solar system's threshold, emerging into the light from outside the heliopause. Some of them travel with the air of eager, conquering armies, paint fresh and banners snapping. Some of them move as if they're on the run from something behind them, out in the galactic dark.\n\nHe watches the movements of the Vex. He learns to tell them apart: the shining silver ones, the brass ones with backswept horns, the ones with eyes glowing white. Occasionally, scattered among them are pockets of Vex stained with verdigris, their arms trailing shawls of moss. All the other Vex keep away from those ones. Twice, he's seen other Vex fight the mossy ones. It looks like the other Vex are frightened of them, as much as Vex can be.\n\nSome timelines have veils drawn over them, a darkness too thick to see through. They push back against Praedyth's sight, resisting.\n\nAll the timelines he sees could be true for some living thing. He doesn't know which are true for him. He doesn't know if that's a meaningful question to ask.\n\nHe asks it anyway, and he keeps looking. There's no reason not to.\n\nHe's got all the time in the world.",

Not infinite mirrored variations of them from different timelines, but simulations all split off the same base, way back in what must have been the Golden Age. Some have grown far different from their progenitors.\n\nSome have not.\n\n\"We have to base the modifications on the ansible system,\" one Duane-McNiadh says. He's either from 227.13 or 227.204. The voices have been bickering in his ear for what feels like hours.\n\n\"The ansible is a thought experiment! It was proved impossible!\" says another. Some people, Praedyth has heard, are their own worst enemy. In the case of Duane-McNiadh, this might be right.\n\n\"An impossible machine could be the only solution to getting us out of an impossible prison—\"\n\n\"So how do you propose to build it?\"\n\nFinally, a decent question. Praedyth jumps in. \"What materials would we need, hypothetically? We're limited by what I've got with me.\"\n\nHe's in contact with six groups of them, all based in Vex network systems near Venus. They must be within ambit of the Vault's entrance, whatever that means. There are more of them further out both in the solar system and in the Vex information networks: up to two hundred and twenty-one more, apparently. There must be a way to contact them too, to use whatever let them connect with him and go even further, till they can figure out why now and what's happening. What the Vex are doing.\n\n\"What do you have with you?\" That's Maya, Dr. Sundaresh. Brisk. The others listen to her when she speaks.\n\nHe has three guns, two disassembled down to their casings for parts. Two boxes of physical ammo and one of Omolon energy cells he's been using to power his radio. He stripped his armor down long ago; he made a comm unit from his helmet and pulled fine coils of wire from the conductive pads on his gauntlets and steel plating from his boots. In his pockets, he's got lint and the wrapper from a candy Pahanin tossed at his head half an hour before they entered the Vault. It's worn soft and folded into the shape of a crane. No Ghost. Her loss is one thing he has never gotten used to after all this time in the Vault; he still wakes up some days expecting the small weight of her on his shoulder.\n\n\"Anything to etch circuitry with?\"\n\n\"If you give me ten minutes.\" He's got a laser pointer and the focusing crystal out of his Omolon rifle.\n\nWhile he works, all of the Chiomas hold their own discussion.\n\n\"If Praedyth exists physically, even if the space he's in isn't strictly real, he has accesses we don't. And vice versa. Maybe together we can get something to work.\"\n\n\"If you believe his story about the Traveler,\" one of them says, doubtful—227.18's Chioma, more skeptical than the others.\n\n\"I've believed weirder,\" another one of them says cheerfully. She pauses and adds, \"Do you remember the first thing we saw the Vex do?\"\n\n\"Go for Maya's throat?\"\n\n\"No—jump into that frame. Clear through the air.\"\n\nSix Chiomas rattle their fingers against their radios in unintentional polyphony, thinking.\n\n\"Think we're close enough to Vex at this point to use one of their tricks?\"\n\n227.18's Chioma turns wry. \"What's a little more tightrope walking between friends?\"\n\nPraedyth lifts his head from his former laser pointer.\n\n\"How much of a chance does this actually have of working?\" This was Shim, usually the quietest one.\n\n\"Oh, negligible. But it's better than chasing after tech disproved centuries ago.\"\n\nPraedyth doesn't have enough scavenged parts for both trials. It's one or the other, a choice they can't undo.\n\nThey take a vote; Praedyth marks the tally with screws on two adjacent flagstones.\n\n227.18's Chioma gives the first aye.\n\nIt's unanimous.\n\nThey're taking the leap.",

Seconds sliced off a clock, marching one by one off into infinity. Go ahead, use your metaphors: A line. A loop. A flat circle. Heard someone say time was like water once. At least that was novel.\n\nThe Vex, they're the closest to understanding it. They've got distance from it. If time's a river, then we're fish and they're diving birds. What's wet mean to a fish? What's it mean to an osprey, who's never fooled by refraction on the water's surface?\n\nHold on now, you're gonna say. This is getting a bit abstract, even for the bodiless echo of a dead guy in the Garden. You want concrete truths? Something simple, digestible? A story to keep the dark out?\n\nYou want time to be a staircase we keep climbing forever. But hey, even a Guardian skips back a step or two now and then. Die with your Ghost in range, and it'll just pop you back to before that bullet, give you the chance to make a fate you like better. Nothing's been simple on Earth since that big white cue ball rolled in from the next neighborhood over. And the stories, they don't work too well as a night-light anymore.\n\nYou're going to say, but the Traveler is our friend, the Traveler likes us, it gave us a Golden Age and garden worlds and Guardians. You're going to say, you wouldn't be alive without it, mister big shot.\n\nWithout it, I wouldn't be stuck in the Black Garden making bets with myself on which Goblin's going to be the next to slip on a soggy leaf and fall off a cliff, either. You took my Light already; you'd better take my advice.\n\nI know the Void's still calling. But I've come untethered—I can't reach it any more. So, if I'm right that I can reach you, you keep your ears open. I don't care how much you hate hearing it. This is important.\n\nThe Vex understand time in a way we never will. Doesn't matter how long I spend here watching them. Doesn't matter how many jury-rigged portals Guardians fling themselves through. We live in time. They use it as a tool. Any moment that's ever happened, any moment that will ever happen, they can go back to it. Play it again till they get it right. Simulate it.\n\nThe Light's a counter to that. They come back, a Guardian comes back. They simulate an ending, a Guardian tears through it. Stalemate.\n\nBut the Vex in the Garden? They bend the knee to the Garden's Heart. It gave them power till you got lucky. The Vex outside, they made a different calculation. They run. But the Vex inside make the same deal you make, every day of your unnatural life. And who's to say that deal won't start paying off for them again sometime soon?\n\nYou can't understand the Vex, and you don't want to understand the Heart. But is your ignorance any more forgivable when it's willful?\n\nLots of questions and not a lot of answers. Better take care, or you'll drown in 'em, surely as you'll drown in time, whether it's anything like a river or not.\n\nYou see?",

You're all eager to get started.\n\nYou come to a place that's a simulation of a world you don't recognize—hills rolling with grain that's just faintly iridescent, the color of their stalks an echo of the purple sky. Something in the distance calls out—a bird, maybe. Something that might be the Traveler lies on the distant horizon, a moon-sized eggshell discarded on the ground. It's spiderwebbed with cracks. No light emerges from them.\n\nDuane-McNiadh walks too quickly, not testing the ground. He's gone before you can blink—fallen through an unseen edge of the simulation. When you move to where he disappeared, tilting your head at a certain angle makes the world give itself over to empty black with glowing wireframe edges that don't do anything to illuminate it. Tilt your head back, and there's nothing but purple wheat and the far-off call of an unknown bird.\n\n\"We have to go after him,\" says Maya, \"we can't just leave him—\"\n\nYou're all still shocked, faces drawn. Shim bends for a rock, squints, and tosses the stone underhand at the edge of the simulation. It disappears before it can hit the peak of its arc. He shakes his head.\n\nYou and Maya repeat the experiment, heads cocked like nervy sparrows. When your rocks hit void, they disintegrate first into wireframe and then into that black nothingness.\n\nYou retreat. You put up a marker at the rise of a hill, for all the good it'll do. You mourn.

On a cliff made of glass, topped with a thin layer of sandy earth and a thinner layer of grass, you get a response that's nearly intelligible.\n\nYou rest the next night at a seashore under the glass cliff. You wake up before dawn at the sound of screaming. You don't have time to find out what's happening before it happens, very finally, to you.\n\n227.72\n\nYou lose Maya.\n\n227.41\n\nYou lose Maya.\n\n227.59\n\nYou lose Maya. \n\nYou mourn.

You'd found a simulation with a city where you discovered a jewelry store, picked out a necklace, brought it home to her, and wished her a happy pseudo anniversary.\n\nMaya didn't like bracelets, said they always fouled her work. Her hair had been getting shaggy again and was due for a trim. She could never decide whether or not to grow it out. She laughed at you lifting weights to maintain simulated muscle, but she spotted for you all the same.\n\nThere are other Mayas out there, layers of them, all the way up to the original, wherever she is. You hope they're doing well. But that doesn't stop you from missing this Maya, missing whatever arguments and discoveries you'd have shared in the rest of the lifetime you'd promised to one another.\n\nShim and Duane-McNiadh pull you up from beside Maya's marker.

And we assume that we're never coming back.\"\n\nNo one breathes.\n\nDown beneath their meeting table, pouches of farmed salmon, beef en culture, buttered carrots, and bok choy drift in the slow turbulence of the sous-vide bath. On Mia's one hundredth anniversary as the New Pacific Systems and Facilities Administrator, she cashed in all (well, not quite all) her favors and installed a pocket restaurant beneath her table on the command deck. She liked the edible metaphor—the idea of watching your food slow-cook all day before the meal. Savor the future you're making.\n\nIf she's right about what's happening now, then there will be no more long-term thinking, no more patience, and maybe no future at all.\n\nShe waits for Xiana to boil over first. Xiana's the water ocean expert. She has the most to lose.\n\nFinch-tiny Xiana McCaig slams her fists down with not a tenth the strength that her chimp-splice muscles could summon. \"Now? NOW? We can't leave now! We just finished the borehole—we're ONE DAY from a crewed expedition into Titan's biggest secret! And you want us to just leave it all?\"\n\n\"I do,\" Mia says, sadly.\n\nMaury Yamashita, her lead diver, leaps in with the details she can always trust him to catch. \"Boss, if we abandon the borehole and the water lock, all the equipment's down there bathing in liquid methane, hydrogen sulfide, carboxylic acid… Leave it too long, and we'll lose everything.\"\n\n\"There are almost three million people on this arcology and its rigs.\" Connectivity supervisor Ismail Barat's Zen-shura training distills his attention down to a single laser-bright point; he is here with Mia, even as his brain drifts on a hundred different data feeds. \"If you're serious about evacuating, we'll need to slot people into SMILE pods and move them as bulk freight. It's the only way to get the population out. There'll be economic damage. There'll be deaths. If this is a false alarm—\"\n\n\"It's not a false alarm,\" the Good Man says.\n\nThis voice Mia didn't expect, but only because he's the new guest at her table. David Miguel Korosec. A man who's literally never harmed a fly, who won't eat plants lest he destroy a sacred entropy pump. Poor David. He came here to make first contact with new life, the wonders that flourish not in Mia's ocean—the methane sea of Titan's surface—but in the enormous water world that lies below Titan's 50-kilometer ice shell. He is an ethicist. He wanted to help them do it right.\n\nXiana crosses her arms. Her recombinant muscles make lean knots at the shoulder anchors, where her bones are more than bone. \"How do you know?\"\n\nKorosec gives her his full attention, respecting her question. He is a tall, graceful, dark-eyed man with lashes so thick he seems like he's wearing permanent eyeliner. Mia remembers something from his book about cognitive empathy: show that you have made a model of their thought; show that you have listened to it. He responds, \"Since I don't have any more information than you, how could I possibly be so certain?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Xiana says, impatiently. \"That's what I asked.\"\n\nHe holds her gaze. Mia thinks that he may have annoyed her but also that he knows he's done nothing wrong. \"The AIs who issued the evacuation order use a hammer-forged extrapolation of human morality. It is tested in trillions of simulations, under the wildest circumstances imaginable, to be sure their moral decisions agree with human values. They're not just rationality pumps. They CARE. They care the way a perfect human being with infinite compassion for all things would care. They couldn't issue an evacuation order unless it was Right. This is not a false alarm.\"",

I want them moored in the submarine pen in three hours. We'll start podding citizens in the domes, then use local blue-water shipping to haul them out for orbital pickup.\" She likes to call the surface ships \"blue-water,\" even though Titan's oceans aren't water, or blue. It reminds people she's old-fashioned. \"Then we evacuate the ship crews. Then we go.\"\n\nIsmail Barat opens his mouth to say something. She will remember, afterward, the way all the fine hairs of his immaculate beard whispered off each other, in that last instant before it happened.\n\nAn alert detonates in her sensorium.\n\nAnd when everyone else at the table (except Ismail) flinches in surprise, Mia knows that she has just watched a history bomb detonate, a blast of irreversible change.\n\n\"Subhanallah,\" Ismail says, which is his third-language Arabic \"wow.\"\n\n\"I guess it's not a false alarm,\" Maury Yamashita murmurs.\n\nThe alert scrolls through Mia's mind, in that hallucinatory screen space that matches but never impairs normal vision. \"TRAVELER DEPARTS IO. TERRAFORMING INCOMPLETE. ACCELERATING TOWARD EARTH. BEHAVIOR UNPRECEDENTED.\"\n\nSometimes Mia thinks she can feel the New Pacific Arcology moving beneath her, as if the flex of that 160-meter substructure of plasteel and spinmetal that anchors New Pac to the ice shell is also a flex in her sinews. Maybe, like Xiana, her bones are more than bones too. And whenever that happens, she thinks: gasoline rains from the sky here, and it is -180 degrees Celsius outside, and no matter how comfortable we grow, life is tenuous here. Human life, especially.\n\nAnd now it's going to end.\n\nShe says to her crew what she will say to the mayor. \"We've got to get everyone off this city. Wherever the Traveler is going, that's where it's safe.\"\n\nThen she looks to David Korosec, who made his name as the Good Man by proposing humanity's best and most rigorous theory of the Traveler's morality. \"The Traveler will protect us, no matter what happens. Correct?\"\n\nDavid looks back at her with all the heartbreaking honesty of a child.\n\n\"Yes,\" he says. \"It can't do anything else.\"",

By the time Ishita Bhattacharya-Garcia has calmed down the panic in Traffic Control, there's nothing left for Mia to do except pace around the edge of her office in irritation and fire civil airspace protests at the intruders.\n\nThey reply in terse code. Her office copies the military message straight to her sensorium: \"New Pac, this is Crown Six, on a zero-zero for your dorsal air lock. Do not deviate your traffic. Send a civilian liaison to meet us at the lock. Over.\"\n\n\"Heck-darned military trying to justify their own existence,\" Mia grumbles. She's been pathologically unable to swear since her great-grandkids. The presence of a famous ethicist at her side doesn't loosen her up.\n\n\"You're right.\" Korosec paces with her at a safe three steps, inside her turn. He seems like a man comfortable at any distance. \"If they just came into the traffic pattern like any other ship, they would be admitting that their precision and urgency are unnecessary. So… this.\"\n\n\"Some American you are,\" Mia teases him. David comes from the North American Empire, Earth's biggest voluntary retro-nationalist republic, full of people who love military pageantry and muscular aerospace displays.\n\nHe smiles with those huge, laughing, haunted eyes. \"I wasn't always the Good Man, you know.\"\n\n\"Do you mind when people call you that?\"\n\n\"Thank you for asking! I hate it. But I like the idea that people can believe in a good person. If they believe in one, they can believe in more.\" His laugh reaches more than his eyes this time, soft and confident. You would never know he was thinking, constantly and acutely, about your idea of Right, and how he could satisfy it. \"May I ask you for a favor?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"I want to be with you when you meet the soldiers.\"\n\nShe looks at him in surprise. \"YOU want to liaise with the military? No offense, David, but you seem like a rough fit.\"\n\n\"I knew her.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"The woman on the radio. Crown Six.\" Two centuries of practice tell Mia there's heartbreak behind that calm voice. \"Before she was uploaded.\"\n\n\"Uploaded?\"\n\n\"She's an Exo now. A troubleshooter for SOLSECCENT.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Mia says. \"That'll be a weird reunion.\"\n\nThe dropships come down so fast Mia is sure they will crash, plunge into the methane sea, and sink like uranium bricks. She watches by cortical video as they make their blindingly bright suicide burns, flesh-peeling, 30-g decelerations into an arrogantly precise hover five meters above the arcology dome. Dark metal figures leap from the dropships, naked in Titan's flash-freeze cold and untroubled by 1.6 atmospheres of pressure. A drizzle of gasoline rain slicks their alloy skin. They move with inhuman efficiency.\n\n\"I don't believe it!\" Mia shakes her head at the absurdity of the universe. \"Like we need transhuman infantry to evacuate a city!\"\n\nShe heads for the door and the elevator, but Xiana McCaig, Ismail Barat, and Maury Yamashita are blocking the way. \"I know,\" Mia says, holding up her hands. \"You refuse to leave. You're staying here with me. You want to save everything you can.\"\n\nXiana, who secretly wanted to impress her, is crestfallen. Dear Maury's diver instincts (never leave your buddy, never hold your breath) puff him up with pride: she trusts him! Ismail makes a small, satisfied sound, as if his prediction just came true. Probably he just won a bet with Xiana.\n\n\"Come on.\" Mia hugs her wayward children. \"Come here, you awful kids. I knew you wouldn't leave, because I'm not going to leave either. I want you all to go to Crisis Command and get your staff set up. Ismail, let's assume we're going to lose the satellites; get all the weather forecasts you can, Titan surface and circum-Saturn space. Maury, try to figure out what exactly is about to hit us. Xiana, check on the Duiker, then help Ismail switch everything you can to local management.\"\n\nOn the way to the dorsal air lock, Mia flicks through camera feeds, statistics, and telemetry, watching over the evacuation effort. Not so long ago, a few million frightened people would've been an administrator's worst nightmare. Not these days. Titan's citizens have grown up with game theory and applied community ethics; it's as unthinkable to beg for a priority evacuation as it would be to ask for an old man's seat on the tram. The families of rig workers and shipping tycoons wait side by side for their tickets to be called, for their bodies to be processed into coldsleep SMILE pods and loaded by the thousands, all equally silent, equally delicate, equally helpless.\n\nMia gets a chill. She doesn't know why she's so certain that it's over now, this calm enlightened goodness, this collective decency. But she is.\n\n\"You're scared?\" David asks quietly.\n\n\"Not scared for myself. For… everything. For what we've built.\"\n\n\"We built it well,\" David assures her. \"This is when we'll be our best.\"",

Changes like Ismail being allowed to pray not in the real direction of Mecca but in the direction Mecca would be if it were transposed from Earth to Titan. Changes like the rise and fall and rise again of the Bray cult of personality. Like the new worlds the Traveler opens up to humanity.\n\nAnd changes like the woman who calls herself Crown Six.\n\nShe has the compact, endomorphic build of someone's mom, a shape that would be disarmingly ordinary if it were not rearmed by glowing eyes, empty sunken cheeks, a thickly armored jaw, and a bare scalp studded with needled sensors. The petrol stink of Titan's atmosphere washes off her, mingled with the clean astringent bite of air lock spray. Like all Exos, she was once a person—someone who gave up her flesh for the tenuous immortality of a war body. Mia, unfairly, thinks she looks like an angry mannequin.\n\n\"Welcome to New Pacific Arcology,\" Mia says. Far beneath them, the lights of residential stacks dim and flicker out as people report to their podding stations. Information kiosks flare up in distant blue, flashing directions to the lost. A vacuum robot scurries along the catwalk behind them.\n\n\"Administrator van der Venne,\" the woman says, with careful consideration, \"thank you for your welcome.\" She turns back to collect some item of equipment. An etiquette flash blinks in the air beside her, totally unpersonalized: it is just the standard warning against substrate chauvinism.\n\n\"Hi, Morgan,\" David Korosec says, with a softness Mia has never heard before, a softness not meant for her ears. \"Are you happier?\"\n\nIt is as if he has waited a long, long time to ask that.\n\nCrown Six looks up in very human surprise. \"David,\" she says, guardedly. \"Tell me you're not still—\"\n\n\"An ethicist? Sorry, Morgan. Still me.\"\n\n\"Then I'm not speaking to you,\" the Exo says and turns to Mia. \"Administrator van der Venne, I'm here under SOLSECCENT's special security protocol for extreme crisis. I must ask for your compliance and all possible assistance with our mission.\"\n\nAn eight-legged crate walks out of the air lock behind her, shepherded by two more silent Exos. The beast of burden proffers body armor and firearms: not just bliss rifles or restraint spiders, but actual, lethal, bullet-shooting guns.\n\n\"No,\" Mia says, with more heat than she intends, but not more than she feels. \"I won't allow you inside with deadly weapons. This is a legally autonomous settlement, chartered under—\"\n\nMorgan points a bladed hand at her. The symbolic suggestion of violence alone is shocking enough to cut Mia's sentence short. \"Administrator van der Venne, there is a CARRHAE WHITE emergency in effect. As an AI-COM operative, I have the right to use force where and how I see fit. So, if you don't get me where I need to go and help me remove any obstacles to my goal, I will realign you with my mission parameters.\" She cocks her head. It's so human. \"Am I clear?\"\n\n\"Are you threatening to shoot me?\" Mia stares at the Exo woman in disbelief. She hasn't seen a gun in nearly 50 years, and now they are not only coming into her habitat, but they're also pointed at her.\n\n\"I won't shoot you.\" The needles of Morgan's scalp glitter. \"But I will tell you that I could, if I found it necessary.\"\n\n\"This is wrong!\" David barks. \"I know you, Morgan. You believe in sacrosanct human will, and the primacy of informed individual agency, and the need for powerful actors to obtain consent. The person I knew would never—\"\n\n\"The person you knew might have had time for this conversation,\" Morgan says, with vicious remove. The pronoun dance suggests shared personal history that Mia has no business asking after or caring about. \"I don't. Administrator, my team will now proceed to Shanice Pell's lab to secure our objective. If you're with me, maybe it gets done faster. If not, maybe it gets done messier. Your choice.\"\n\nOf course. Of course it's about Shanice Pell. Who else?\n\nA silent alarm throbs in Mia's sensorium, like a snake coiling around her wrist. Down in the residential blocks, one of her citizens has lifted one too many boxes and manifested presymptoms of a heart attack. EMTs are on the way, so it probably won't be the day's first death. Probably. Life burns so easily. It's her job to stand up to those who forget that.\n\n\"I'll escort you to the lab,\" she says. \"May I assume that you're interested in containing some data at the Pell lab? Should I close our airspace? We are in the middle of—\"\n\n\"You'll do nothing,\" Morgan says, confidently but incorrectly. \"I'm killing all your satellite uplinks except for text and basic flight telemetry.\"\n\n\"Who ordered this?\" Mia demands. \"On what grounds can SOLSEC impose some high-handed protocol on my Arcology?\"\n\nMorgan does not make the obvious correction: not who ordered this, but what.",

There is something like a whittled mulberry branch stuck in her throat.\n\n\"Do you realize this is your fault?\" Morgan-2 groans, inviting no dispute about whether it is in fact Mia van der Venne's fault (yes, in a complicated way) but, rather, asking her if she accepts it.\n\nDo you see, Mia? Do you see how you killed them?\n\nIt was a good plan, she'd thought. Smuggling Shanice Pell out on the evacuation ships was the right thing to do. Because it put Shanice Pell's personal autonomy above the needs of any enigmatic emergency protocol. Because it gave Shanice a choice about what to do with her data, instead of yielding that choice to Morgan and her Exos.\n\n\"Why?\" David Korosec whispers. \"Morgan, you murdered all those people… why?!\"\n\nIt should've worked. Mia never betrayed herself to the Exos' electronic warfare with a telltale signal. She didn't warn Pell with a crude mechanical sign, like a blinking light or a gushing faucet, that a watching AI might detect. She hid her alarm in the social chaos of the Arcology's evacuation: simply by failing to renew a hold order, she allowed one of her security frames to detain a Clovis Bray executive in Dome 2. The Clovis corporate embassy sent a team to unsnarl the situation, and that unexpected Clovis sortie triggered Shanice Pell's sentinel programs and kicked off her red-alert evacuation protocol. She was already evacuating, just like everyone else, but now she believed (correctly) that someone was after her.\n\nShanice and her lab ran before Morgan's Exos could reach them. Ran with the data Morgan came to silence.\n\nThe probe. This must be about the Pell deep-space probe. That \"demonstration of self-sufficiency\" that caused such vicious, quiet controversy. What did it find?\n\nWhen Morgan-2's network senses warned her of Pell's flight, Mia thought she'd won. Saved the radically self-sufficient scientist from the big bad Warmind and its paranoid goons.\n\nBut Morgan-2 had just covered her glowing eyes. \"Administrator. Didn't you understand that I was the humane option? Didn't you think?\"\n\nAnd down from the sky, swift and stealthy as the Warsat that fired it, came the invisible discharge of an X-ray laser to light the shuttle's propellant like a lantern. The beam path was hot-white, straight as poured silver, collapsing instantly: a crash of pure-tone thunder as the tunnel of burnt air closes in on itself. And the shuttle opening like a ghastly blossom, the shape of a thing going upward very quickly, no longer in one piece.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Mia had gasped, not understanding at first: Was it an accident? Had the phantom disaster finally arrived on Titan and struck its first blow? This was the age of life, and governments did not, ever, use force against human beings. There were always alternatives. Every soul sacred. Every evil treatable.\n\nThen she understood what the Warmind had done.",

And when that pull lets go, there will be a wave to make Ziusudra and Atrahasis and Noah and Manu and Deucalion cower in fear. Bergelmir might have navigated a deluge of blood, but not even he had to sail on liquid methane.\n\nNor reckon with the apocalyptic tidal forces of a second ocean, fourteen times as vast as Earth's oceans combined, buried 50 kilometers below the surface.",

At nearly -200 degrees Celsius, the methane is so viciously frigid that vacuum, the acme of pure cold, is actually keeping Maury warm: he wears a softsuit stuffed with microscopic layers of vacuum, packed in turn with crystalline nanostructures that prevent even light from crossing the gaps. This means the chill cannot get in… and his body heat cannot get out.\n\nSo, he is now baking to death in an ocean as cold as Dante's ninth. Of course, he could vent heat; the suit allows that. But the spreading warmth will force nitrogen out of the methane-ethane ocean, and the bubbles will slow him down. This is unacceptable for a lot of reasons, one of which is that he's already too slow. Liquid methane is about half as dense as water, so his huge fins and hissing thrusters struggle to push against it.\n\nAnother reason is that he will die if he can't get back inside in time.\n\n\"Maury,\" his sensorium whispers. He's turned the volume way down. \"Come back. This isn't worth your life.\"\n\nSorry, Mia, he thinks. It has to be worth my life, or I'm worth more than them, and I know I'm not. I put them there.

The shadow of a behemoth supercarrier blocks the dim sunlight above: he feels the thin howl of the ship's thrusters, fighting to move out of mooring at Dome 2 and haul another load of frozen people to an evacuation lifter. If Maury looks down, his lights illuminate a dusty wash of azotosomic plankton, primitive methane life. If he looks back to Dome 1, he can barely see the sleekly fat form of the Duiker, the water-ocean research submarine, docked to the arcology's underside. E. F. Babatunde is in there now, probably begging someone to tell them what's happening.\n\nHe heads down. His dolphins are already safe in open water. He has to get the swarmers out of their research pen.\n\n\"Tidal anchors decoupled,\" Xiana McCaig reports. \"Dome 1 substructure is as loose as I can make it. Dome 2 is showing temperature faults, but I've got drones on the way. Maury, please. We have no idea what'll happen when the quake hits. Get back in here!\"\n\n\"I'll be back in a few,\" he promises. \"I'm just going to cut the research pen open so the swarmers can get free—\"\n\n\"Oh, Allah,\" Ismail Barat whispers. \"It's gone.\"\n\n\"What's gone?\" Mia demands.\n\n\"The tidal pull. The ghost mass. It just… left. The moon is collapsing back to spheroid shape. I'm detecting primary waves in the subsurface ocean—it's a quake. It's a quake! Maury, get away from the substructure! Get clear!\"\n\nMaury imagines 60-plus meters of bulging moon, Titan's mass hauled up into a teardrop pointed at the sky—suddenly released. Smashing and scraping and grinding back into equilibrium. Cracks in the ice spewing plumes of water and ammonia. Continent-sized shelves slamming and rebounding and calving like bergs. The whole vast inner ocean sloshing back into its shape.\n\n\"The swarmers,\" he says, and he jettisons his buoyancy tanks.\n\nWithout that lift he is so much denser than the bad water around him that he plunges like a skydiver toward the cross brace below, where the swarmer pen is anchored. Titan's gravity may be gentle, but even gentle acceleration adds up. He hits hard, and the spinmetal surface blasts the air out of his lungs. He gasps and gags. Scrabbles for purchase before he slides off and falls into the abyss. He's going over—no! No! He is not going over! He will not fall!",

        "description": "The gecko-grip surfaces on his forearms catch—and hold.\n\n\"Whew,\" he says, and he has never meant anything so inane so deeply.\n\nThe swarmers seethe and pulsate in the perforated plastic sac. Not Titan's highest life, nor its lowest, they hive across the icy sea-bottom in enormous braided patterns that speak to Maury of intelligence. Not individually—not even at the hive level—but some kind of vast concert, conducted, perhaps, by leviathans down beneath the ice shell, communicating across the barrier by magnetic whisper that the swarmers receive via organic SQUIDs. An ecology spanning methane life and water-ammonia life. Why? How?\n\nMaury wants so badly to know. But if his curiosity brought the swarmers here, only for them to be caught in the quake, dashed apart against the arcology struts, he'll never forgive himself.\n\nHe should've set up a remote release, but he was complacent. He gets a fistful of the pen's smart plastic surface and fires the \"disintegrate\" signal through his glove. The polymer shreds and the swarmers scatter, their tiny bodies siphoning liquid methane as they pump down and away. Safe. Safe. \"I made it!\" he calls, jubilantly. \"On my way back up!\"\n\nThe quake hits.\n\nA hundred and fifty meters below, the icy basis of Kraken Mare rolls like liquid. The arcologies answer the low geological wail with a cacophony of groans and shrieks, joints flexing, tethers snapping taut, substructures soaking up unthinkable mechanical energy, trying to keep anything from—\n\nBreaking.\n\nSomething must've frozen hard down in Dome 2's substructure. Something must've grown brittle. The snap is almost spinal. The smashed hulk of a drone tumbles past Maury as he tries to scull backward, away from the superdense arm of plasteel dropping like a guillotine through all-too-thin methane to strike him in the—\n\nAn absence.\n\nHe's on the ice seafloor, two hundred and forty meters down. Someone's shouting in his ear. It's Mia. She's always there in an emergency. Always there for her team. \"Maury! Maury, you're awake! Respond if able!\"\n\nHis sensorium tells him he's been in a medical coma while cytomachines fight to save his life. Massive blunt trauma. Concussion. The suit, as ever, tougher than the human being inside. Dome 2 has toppled partially; it's leaning toward the sea on damaged substructure. He should go help…\n\n\"Maury,\" Mia says, in a level voice he does not recognize. He's never heard her scared before. \"Listen to me. The quake is over. But a shelf of ice collapsed into Kraken Mare. The displacement wave is coming in now and you won't be safe on the bottom. You must reach the surface and get above wave level. That will be at least 50 meters.\"\n\nSurface? Wave? About 50 meters? Maury cues a blast of nootrope to clean up his thinking and grunts aloud in shock. He gets it. Oh, he gets it now, he has to RUN. \"I understand. I've lost my buoyancy. Ascending on thrusters.\"\n\nHe makes it to the surface. He's up there in plenty of time. He can even see Dome 1, still intact, though a lot of the surrounding rigging is damaged. One of the creepy Exo soldiers stands outside, beckoning to him with a laser dazzle, guiding him in.\n\nMaury opens his suit wings to their full membranous span. A single mighty stroke of paramuscle cups the air and hauls him up out of the sea. He's aloft! Titan air is thick, and Titan gravity is light, and like a huge bat he can fly. He puts his head down and starts building altitude, headed towards the beckoning Exo.\n\nThe Exo's laser blinks code at him. GO WITH GOD, YOU POOR—\n\nMaury looks back.\n\nFirst, he sees the supercarrier, tragically buoyant, tragically light, built for seas with gentle one-meter tides but now riding the greatest wave Titan has ever seen, directly into Dome 2's crippled understructure. In 152 kilopascals of air pressure, the pandemonium sound of the collision has the gut-mulching power of a rocket booster.\n\nThe entire arcology collapses down onto the ship, into the sea.\n\nThen he blinks past the devastation and recognizes the sheer scale, the utter speed, the complete imminence of that unthinkable methane wave coming down at him.\n\n\"Oh, man,\" he says.",

I need to get some rest. Well, I can't explain the mechanism, but tests show neurochemical cascades increasing in frequency and severity over time. Individuals differ in their expression, but there's a clear trend when examined in the aggregate. Approximately eighty percent of the K1 crew is suffering similarly: intrusive thoughts, insomnia, narcolepsy, nightmares, and in the worst cases—as we saw with Helsha Rell—hallucinations, auditory and visual. It's a threat to the project.\"\n\n\"And the twenty percent?\"\n\n\"Individuals who've yet to be exposed. And yes, before you ask, I did witness the effect in action. I took the levels on an unexposed technician, Keleen Vance, and reexamined them after just an hour with it. Despite no outward changes of behavior, there was a marked drop in her serotonin and a commensurate rise in cortisol. After a week of work at Site 3, she was requesting sedatives as a sleep aid. Now she wants something stronger. Something to knock her out.\"\n\n\"Does your report include any recommendations?\"\n\n\"Only my best guess: Restrict direct exposure to thirty minutes per day, rotate teams between sites each week to limit proximity. And we need to plan for attrition. People need to get off this rock or they'll go crazy. Heck, I'm near the breaking point, and I'm supposed to help everyone else.\"\n\n\"I think you're right. You do need a break. Come with me when I head back to Earth for my next quarterly. We can come up with a plan for who will replace you in the coming days.\"\n\n\"Fine. [yawns] Fine.

Wars of greed.\n\nFrom war, death.\n\nFrom death, an end.\n\nFrom endings, beginnings.\n\nOne such is now sung in the key of pain—Azavath's truth, the all of her, torn free with a surgeon's grace.\n\nMalkanth's ears bleed as her sister's unmaking reveals her being.\n\nIn the echoes of Azavath's screams, ancient histories reveal themselves…\n\nSONG OF LIFE\n\nThe Song was not always a corruption. It began as a gift, stolen from the Gardener. In efforts to understand the unknowable realities of the orb's incredible gifts, a signal was found—a repeating tune, the Song of Creation. Its frequencies were heard across the stars, wherever life's promise took hold. Some among the Ammonites worshipped it. Some among the Hive did the same. Still others sought to understand it that they might cage it, that they might control it—for to control life is to control death. Such ambition was not new; such ambition was as old as understanding. The melody was captured and studied. The frequencies replicated.\n\nBut the orb's mysteries were not so easily brought to light. The Song, for all its beauty, did not alone grant life. It was theorized that the Song was not a song at all, but many. That within its refrain, untold rhythms spoke their own truths, free and clear of the whole.\n\nCenturies passed. The Song remained untamed. Life moved on.\n\nSONG OF DEATH\n\nThe Choir formed in celebration of the Song. Performances marked the passage of seasons. But the Song's lie eventually began to corrupt the spirit of those who heard its tune. The melody was a reminder. The orb was a catalyst. And the Song was of the orb. Yet, those who embraced the Song were merely instruments and nothing more. Life remained beyond their grasp, while they remained ever in death's. Those of the Choir had given all of themselves. All was not enough.\n\nThe First Conductor was assassinated by one who sang an Aria of her own making. She, whose name has been stricken, had found notes hidden in the frequencies. Reversed and mirrored in pitch, she weaved them together and sang her beautiful abomination, until the Conductor wept and bled and screamed and fell. The Stricken fled, fearful of her crime. But others found promise anew in her art. The Stricken was captured and subjected to inquisition so that her song might be understood. This was before Understandings—before most things—when the first notes of a new Song were written.",

        "description": "IN THESE NOTES, BEAUTIFUL OBLIVION\n\nThe war had raged for centuries. One of many. Just another. As irrelevant as the next. The stories of the Choir and their Deathsong were thought to be nothing more than folklore—wholly untrue at best, vastly exaggerated at worst… They were demons who'd sought life's gift, only to corrupt its beauty.\n\nThe homeworld of a species no longer on record—erased from the World's Grave, and thus from memory, as punishment for their transgressions—had kept itself safely removed from the battles being waged on the far side of their system. The location was safeguarded to protect the homeworld from the Hive's wrath. Its orbit was defended by an array of advanced offensive mechanics—cannons, mobile suits, mines, gravity slings, and more. They were protected. They were safe.\n\nThey never noticed the small crafts slip through their defenses. Twenty in total, landing in sequence at set coordinates along the planet's equator. Four trillions souls were about their days and nights as an unknown melody caught the breeze. It was beautiful—an ethereal gift and the end of all things. The Choir sang. Only twenty strong. As their voices grew in volume, the people started to scream. The planet's crust shifted and cracked. The seas roiled and spilled out over the land. The core shook. The ground shattered. Defenses scrambled. It was too late. Less than an hour after the Song began, the hidden homeworld of a forgotten people split in twain. These are the Song's powers, its gifts—anti-life and oblivion.\n\nREBIRTH\n\nMalkanth braces as the pain of her sister's screams threatens to turn her mind to liquid.\n\nBut she is strong.\n\nAnd almost finished.\n\nAzavath's being was tied intimately to her purpose—to learn the Song, perfect her notes, write her own Aria, and become death. That she held so tightly to legends of the Song's true power surprised Malkanth.\n\nEven Ir Yût, one of the Crota's most cherished, had long since given up on rebuilding the Choir, yet Azavath was driven by this desire.\n\nMalkanth feels pride well up.\n\nHer sister, like herself, like their brother—all lesser in the eyes of those of purer bone—still nurtured ambitions beyond the festering cowardice of those who chose politics over action.\n\nThe sword logic had failed them, but they would not fail the Swarm.\n\nMalkanth makes her final cut.\n\nAzavath's roar shreds her throat and she falls silent, her body convulsing against the bolts, then becoming motionless.\n\nFor an instant, Malkanth holds her sister's essence. She wishes to say farewell. But just as quickly, the wisp that was her sister sparks and blinks out. Malkanth recoils.\n\nAkrazul jumps from his altar, lunging at Malkanth.\n\nUnflinching, Malkanth makes a single cut—deep, clean—tearing her brother's essence free from his physical self.\n\nAkrazul's body crumples to the ground.\n\nHis soul is bigger and stronger than his sister's. Angrier. Meaner.\n\nFor an instant, Malkanth worries Azavath's vessel will be unfit to contain their brother's rage.\n\nShe shoves the Severed Knight's essence into Azavath's empty shell. Their sin is complete.\n\nNow come the consequences.",

A leader will rise… a new Prince to be shaped into a King.\n\nAmong the plotting throng, Hashladûn and her sisters remain silent.\n\nThey'd hoped for one to prove their worth and stake their claim, but the long, violent road to Zulmak's rise has seeded doubt. The Daughters hold little confidence in the Pit's ability to provide a victor truly born of the sword logic.\n\nZulmak has been impressive. But a King? Surely not, for whom has he faced? What competition had the Swarm mustered?\n\nThe aftermath of their father's murder and their grandfather's war has left them bereft of warriors of a caliber befitting royalty. The Light has seen it so. The hated Guardians came and inflicted their will upon the Hive—on the Moon and across the system. Now all that remains are scraps of a broken legacy.\n\nTo Hashladûn's mind, the Pit has proven a failure, regardless of Zulmak's triumph.\n\nFurther, the Daughters hold a secret belief that their forbearers have yet to fail the logic's call. Crota and Oryx were both defeated, yes, but not for the first time, and the Daughters still have faith that the King of Bone, the Taker of Will, the one and true King of Shapes, would never fall as far as to be lost in eternity.\n\nIf nothing else, the terror of their deeds—the memory of their conquests—lives on, like nightmares that may be awakened for the weak to truly know fear.\n\nIn that faith, the Daughters have made plans of their own, schemes to rekindle the greatness of their lineage, strategies born beyond the Pit.\n\nThus, deep beneath the Hellmouth, the heirs probe strange new possibilities from ancient discovery. Possibilities that will forgo the Pit to carve new paths and new Understandings through which the logic may yet prove their grandfather's authority.\n\nHowever, those who would see their family unseated—those among whom they now stand—would mark their research as an affront. \"The logic is the logic,\" they would say. \"It is known, and it is good.\" But they lack imagination. The logic is not simply brute force. It is cunning and guile. It is survival. It is victory born of all that makes a King mighty.\n\nIn the Pit, Zulmak unleashes a battle cry. He is ready to be done with it all. He is ready to claim his crown.\n\nHashladûn considers him with disgust—he will never be a King, only ever a tool, blunt and brutal.\n\nShould he be anointed as a champion of the Pit… Should he be crowned… the Daughters' plots will be threatened before they ever truly begin.",

Fear grips the craven court of the Necropolis.\n\nAll recognize Azavath, but she is no fighter, and her Song, though deadly, is far from the perfected pitch of others among the Broken Choir.\n\nIn each hand Azavath grips heavy cleavers, each weighted down by chunks of their victims. Below, a thousand corpses rest in pieces.\n\nBrave Zulmak, he who came so very close to proving the logic, is spread wide, limbs removed, a cavity where his heart once beat.\n\nThe congregation asks Azavath to explain herself. She is no warrior, yet she fights like a conqueror. She has sought no claim, yet she has butchered a champion. The logic was almost met. What gives her the right to…?\n\nThe wicked scholar admonishing the 'Singer is split in two as one of Azavath's cleavers moves through him as if he were air.\n\nThe congregation panics as Azavath's rage is unleashed upon them.\n\nThey are not fighters.\n\nThey are plotters and manipulators and cowards.\n\nThey are everything Akrazul hates.\n\nHis new flesh—his new bone—allows him to manifest that hatred with swift, ruthless aggression. He thanks his sister and knows she would be proud of the blood he now sheds. She gave of herself that he might once again fight for all they believed in. On this high perch above the gore-filled pit, as the would-be advisers to a nonexistent King flail and fall, he kills for her, in her, as her. Tower after tower. Coward after coward. The bodies of the truly unworthy litter their blood temples. Screams echo through the expanse. Akrazul and Azavath are one, and in that joining, he is no longer the same—Akrazul no more, only his anger remains.\n\nHe considers that the slaughter of the puppet masters was not part of Malkanth's plan. She would be upset, but she no longer matters. Only vengeance matters. Only the ending of all who have failed the Swarm will sate his lust for carnage.\n\nAmong the congregation, the Daughters of Crota move to escape. But Besurith turns to her sisters, asking them to consider the moment. As the four edge beyond Azavath's warpath, they use the chaos to cover their own sins. Drawing daggers from their cloaks, Hashladûn, Besurith, Kinox, and Voshyr assassinate those they believe to be a threat to their schemes. Azavath will take the blame, and even if they are found out, there will be none left to challenge them.\n\nAS BELOW…\n\nA voice calls from the Pit.\n\nAzavath pauses her massacre.\n\nThe voice is familiar, yet strange—other.\n\nBelow, Malkanth hovers over the broken bodies that cover the ground.\n\nAzavath eyes her remaining victims and then turns to her sister.\n\nMalkanth calls again.\n\n\"Brother… I have need of you.\"\n\nAzavath leaves the high red perch, while the few remaining of the congregation flee, led by the Daughters, who feign distress.\n\nIn the Pit, Azavath considers Malkanth with care. The silent Deathsinger is confused, uncertain. Malkanth floats near, a gaping wound scarring her center, and whispers in her sister's ear…\n\n\"Our path is flawed. Your rage is a burden. Let me lift it from you…\"\n\nAs Malkanth sings a familiar song in an unfamiliar pitch, Azavath's eyes widen with recognition. She tries to speak but cannot, her voice having been shredded in her unmaking.\n\nThe song continues, and Azavath bleeds, from ear and nose and eye and mouth. Her bone cracks, and her flesh bubbles until she breaks. Malkanth smiles once more. The Deceiver's plan is unfulfilled, but there is victory in stalled sword logic.\n\nHashladûn peers into the Pit as the last of the congregation make their escape. Zulmak is defeated, the new champion shattered. There are none to claim the logic's prize. The Daughters' plans to return their father to glory is no longer threatened.\n\nAnd, as it was before it all began, all that remains are failed sword logic and the unknown promise of nightmares.",

Yet, you would allow poor, sweet Azavath to give all of herself for you—to extinguish her essence that you might take her place. But her essence is not the whole of it. What of her gift? The melody that echoes in her soul is a rare treasure. So few are as purely connected to the pain of our being as those worthy of the Choir. Still, precious Azavath gives everything for you to be whole, trading her art for your rage, when rage is so easily born, so readily nurtured, so pathetically revered. But… such is the depth of her caring. Such is the folly of love, that we would surrender the best of our being, the entirety of our existence, to please those we cherish most. What, then, of the other—your wicked sister, Malkanth? Her fondness for you is tempered by ambition—by the stoic truth she finds in sword logic. She sees all, knows much, and wields secrets as weapons like few before her. That she herself holds you dear is a certainty you feel to your core. For she is—has always been—devout and true. She served the fallen Prince faithfully, despite the questionable calling of your line. But her loyalties were of little consequence when the Children of Light cursed these halls and slaughtered their way to forbidden chambers where they killed the son, tempted the father, and set in motion a war that would end a King's reign. But you know all of this, great and powerful Akrazul. Such histories are the framework for your rage. Such violent truths are marked upon your body, mind, and soul. Your severing is the culmination of a lifetime fighting to prove not just your own worth, but the worth of all bound to the tainted sect of your disgraced brood. I wonder… Did Malkanth ever offer to restore your loving sister? Your body will rest hollow when your soul is freed. Why, then, must Azavath perish when a vessel of her own blood and bone sits idle? Because, angry, blind, sad Akrazul, your sister knows what you do not: You are a tool. A weapon. Nothing more. Your rage—your sole value. Azavath would have seen different. She would have smiled at your renewed pride once you were made whole in her flesh, but soon your anger would have been more than she could bear. And so, there it is… the broken siblings blinded by their sinful desires. One—Malkanth, the liar—would see you sharpened and loosed upon those she deems weak, but at the cost of the only living creature you hold dear. The other—tender, loving Azavath—would bind your fury within her love, making you lesser as she attempts to nurture your pain. Both are flawed. Both as unworthy as any. What then will you do? Once whole, will you remain a puppet to a would-be puppet master? Or will you take your sister's gift and become your final, fleeting shape—rage unleashed, and nothing more, until all are dust?\"\n\nThese words became a steady hum picking at the back of Akrazul's mind.\n\nHe did not hear them—but felt them.\n\nThey etched a truth upon his being in the instant between Azavath's final scream and his own rending.\n\nAll went dark and gray and then he gasped anew—his first breath in his sister's shell—and through new eyes, he saw Malkanth smiling down on him and knew the whispers were not deceit, but a promise.\n\nThe edge of his blade slid into Malkanth's sternum—a fatal wound, deep and clean.\n\nAkrazul, now Azavath, would be no one's pawn.\n\nHer rage would be unfettered.\n\nThe Swarm would suffer.\n\nThen, the wicked offspring of the Light would, too, and any others who stood before her.\n\nThe coming slaughter would end only in dust—hers or all others'.",

My dismissal of the Swarm's legacy is not a plea for you to consider gods wholly removed from the here and now. Quite the opposite…\n\"The Dragon and the Worm.\n\"The Larva and the Queen.\n\"The peasant and the god.\n\"So many deities.

Evolution-to-evolution.\n\"Always idols to guide and punish and love and destroy.\n\"But are any true?\n\"Whom must we placate with worship and reverence?\n\"With offerings and sacrifice?\n\"With praise as armor for their frail egos?\n\"The truth is, dear child…\n\"There are no gods.\n\"Only absolutes.\n\"Yet, here we sit on the edge of the greatest unmaking.\n\"Time is no longer time when the radiolaria dance upon history gone and yet to be.\n\"Space is no longer space when we have torn reality to carve out our own secret planes of being.\n\"Death is no longer death when the Champions of the Light rise and fall, never backing down, never truly knowing defeat.\n\"All that remains is ignorance—the last absolute, the final unassailable truth.\n\"Time can be bent and broken—redirected to the whims of those with the knowledge and the will.\n\"Space can be shredded asunder—excavated to discover new and ancient realms not chained to understanding.\n\"Death can be ignored—through impossible energies and advanced technologies both physical and indistinguishable from magic.\n\"But ignorance is the unconquerable constant.\n\"One can learn more, but none can learn all.\"\n\n\"What then, when immortality and the totality of space and time can be joined to learn the last of the unknowns?\"\n\n\"When the final absolute falls, reality will shudder and blink, and a new absolute will emerge… an ending, total and complete.\"\n\n\"You wish to see that end?\"\n\n\"I wish to ensure it does not come to pass.\"\n\n\"Will you take me with you?\"\n\n\"I had considered such a thing, but, no. Your purpose is served.\"\n\n\"How so, if I have failed?\"\n\n\"You have failed in furthering your own goals, poor thing, not mine.\"\n\nMalkanth considers these words and is overcome with a sudden, final sense of dread as she feels her essence fade to nothingness.\n\nHer last thought is of her sister…",

As with Oryx. As with Crota. As with the whole of existence, whenever one seeks to challenge their station.\n\"You, sweetest Azavath, were that flaw.\n\"Your sister never fully considered the connection between yourself and your brother, never fully considered the blinding hate of his rage, nor how it would manifest in the first moments of its new life.\n\"And that rage? It has betrayed you as well. The faith you placed in Akrazul—that, once given a new form in your old skin, he would find purpose beyond his fury—was thrown away the instant he was reborn, and his blade, in your hand, punctured Malkanth's heart.\n\"The wound still aches. Can you feel it?\n\"Yet, the heart still beats.\n\"Weaker now, but it will heal, if you allow it.\"\n\nAzavath rises, unsure—confused.\n\nThe room is familiar, but she is alone beyond the words scratching in the recesses of her subconscious.\n\nThe floor is cold and harsh. She lifts herself as she gains focus. These eyes are not her own. This skin is familiar but stolen.\n\nIn a heap next to her is the husk that was her brother…\n\nAnd she remembers her final moments.\n\nThe inquisition that tore her soul free from its physical cage. The purpose of such a horrid ceremony.\n\n\"Why have I returned?\" she ponders to no one but the unseen whispers.\n\n\"To see the truth of your sin.\n\"Not in its blasphemy, but in its folly.\n\"More, to reconsider your gift and the worthiness of the Songs you have yet to sing.\"\n\n\"Why am I cloaked in my sister's bone?\"\n\n\"Your brother's anger—the seething doom that has festered in him—has been unleashed. As planned, but it is beyond controlling.\n\"He hates all who are not you.\n\"He hates them for their failures, for their mockery… for creating a present that required your sacrifice to secure an unknown future.\"\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"The Pit. Even now. He has gone to inflict his righteous judgment upon the Swarm.\"\n\n\"He will kill them all.\"\n\n\"Or most. He is truly mighty.\"\n\n\"He is worthy.\"\n\n\"At one time, maybe. Now?

Even if the notes are the same, my pitch, in this body, will never join with the Aria's to create the notes you wish to conjure.\"\n\n\"Malkanth is dead, you are other.\n\"Azavath is dead, you are other.\n\"Soon Akrazul will be dead. And you will be other.\n\"You will be whole—the A'Airâm reborn…\"\n\n\"The First Death?\"\n\n\"You know the legend?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Will you lead the Choir?\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n\"Then gather the maw from your old form and complete your rebirth. Become the First Death and serve as a catalyst for that which may one day stand against oblivion.\"\n\n\"And for this honor—for all you have done—what do you require in return?\"\n\n\"I seek no praise.\n\"I need only for your Song to become that which I desire.\"\n\n\"A weapon.\"\n\n\"And nothing more.\"",

Be that strength.\n\"Rise the Crimson Spire.\n\"Signal your coming.\n\"Challenge the Light.\n\"And when the 'heroes' come to condemn your proclamation of sovereignty and conquest, I offer this gift—the essence of your fallen champion.\n\"I know you question my motives, but we are sisters of a kind and bound by blood.\n\"And this gift will be one of many…\n\"Use it—birth a ravager to protect all you hope to build.\"\n\n\"What of the treacherous witch below? She and her siblings cost us much with their sinful games.\"\n\n\"That witch, in all her forms, is the patron saint of both your gifts.\n\"Her actions freed mighty Zulmak, that he might be remade and bound to your will.\"\n\n\"And the second offering?\"\n\n\"The Choir of the Deathsong will rise from the failures of the Pit.\n\"Failures made possible by the siblings' ambitions.\n\"Ambitions that have granted you a champion and the Choir.\n\"Do with them all your fathers could not.\"\n\nAnd then all is silent.\n\nAS BEYOND…\n\nSomewhere, in a shadowed realm, the Whisper Queen smiles as she ponders death.\n\nShe has gifted the Swarm a weapon of beautiful, perfect destruction and a mighty champion—the means to move beyond their pathetic adherence to a sword logic beyond their grasp.\n\nThe Daughters will see these gifts as a boon—a rising tide to lift the Swarm and challenge the Light.\n\nBut a grander design is at play.\n\nThe bloodline of Oryx has run its course…\n\nThe luminous conquerors will come once more—they, the bringers of death. And the final, desperate gasp of a dead King's legacy will serve as an anvil upon which a new sword will be hammered, strengthened, and forged for wars yet to come—the purest extension of the logic's intent.",

It was under our noses the whole time.\n\nSomething lies deep below the Moon's surface, and I believe it's more important than we initially believed. It's something we may not be ready for—I've found a Pyramid, akin to your description. It's what we've been hunting for.\n\nThe Pyramid has reopened a box in my mind, long thought locked, its contents frightening and heartbreaking. It's forcing me to confront memories buried ages ago. People, places, vile creatures—all are rushing to the forefront of my consciousness. If it's affecting me like this, what will it do to our loved ones, those we've sworn to protect?\n\nI vividly remember the stories from that night. The sky burning green, the roar of thunder ripping through the darkness, and the Eater of Hope tearing through our ranks. Crota, the merciless Hive prince whose dark campaign to pursue the Traveler led to the slaughter of countless worlds—all in the name of his father, Oryx, the Taken King.\n\nI'll never forget the Vanguard's failed attempt to reclaim the Moon from the Hive. The Great Disaster. We lost thousands, needlessly. I fear we are on the verge of doing so once again.\n\nNow the Hive are spreading across the Moon, perhaps mounting a defensive or some other insidious machination. We must access the inside of the Pyramid by whatever means necessary, to find what I believe may be the key to our battle with the Darkness. It's too critical to allow the Hive to interfere.\n\nThis is our duty. My fate has guided me here. We will set it right. The price will be high, but the alternative is not an option. It will take the collective might of all Guardians working together to lead us to a brighter future.",

They tease us with a life we once knew, prying into our minds and attacking our most vulnerable points. This assault on our emotions is aimed to weaken us and our sense of purpose. But I will not waver. Emotions can be overcome. I don't fully comprehend the power these Nightmares wield, or if they can truly be conquered, but I have yet to meet an enemy who could not be.\n\nI cannot shake the feeling that we are being toyed with, that these Nightmares are a hindrance to our goal. We must not lose sight of what they are guarding.\n\nPerhaps they wish to make us question ourselves and our will to fight, to overcome. Now, I lived in the darkness for years, barely escaping with what was left of my life. The toll it took on me to refortify myself is something I refuse to experience again. If the Pyramid is indeed testing us, it will find we are more than up to the challenge.\n\nThe Pyramid has also spawned another entity, one that presents a different kind of danger. It does not attempt to harm me physically. Instead, it seeks to wage psychological warfare—a battlefield I have lived on. The Pyramid had the gall to bring Sai Mota before me, devoid of her corporeal form, hoping to shake my resolve.\n\nI will admit, seeing this phantom was jarring, but the Pyramid underestimates my will. It was almost comforting to see her again. Nothing will break my determination. I can't allow it.

Their screams of agony haunted me for so long, but never did I anticipate hearing their voices again. The Darkness is deceptive and seeks to corrupt from within. It knows just where to strike.\n\nTerrible pain has resurfaced from a scar that I assumed had healed. Now something is scratching and clawing its way out. When we went after Crota to seek retribution for the Great Disaster, we knew there would be risks. We did not know it would be a suicide mission. I'm ashamed to say I never wanted to think about these events again. How can we move on from our past if we continue to live in it?\n\nThey were the last family I had before my time in the Dark.\n\nSix of us went in. Only I made it out.\n\nEriana-3, my leader—our first encounter consisted of an argument over a piece of music I loathed. Eriana was enamored with its melody and sought to convince me of its merits. Her unequivocal honesty in the face of dissenting opinions led me to pledge my total devotion and trust to her. I would hum the tune quietly to myself in the Dark, to stave off the madness that was consuming me.\n\nOur Titan, Vell, was the first to fall. I mourn him to this day and think of his courage in times of despair. We should all be so valiant in the face of overwhelming odds. Today, I will need his example more than ever.\n\nSai's knives were as sharp as her wit. She laughed in the very face of danger. Now, the same laugh that I heard countless times and that once brought me great comfort rings painfully in my memory and triggers nothing but anguish. How I wish I could amend that! She deserved more.\n\nPoor Omar was skeptical of our chances, yet his bravery endured—even as his Light was pulled from him by the Hive Wizard, the Heart of Crota. Few possess the fortitude required to press on when all hope seems lost. He has imbued me with the strength to weather the coming storm.\n\nAnd you know Toland, the Shattered—the mad Warlock who knew more than he let on. I had my doubts about him in the past, but time changes perspectives. I now respect his dedication to learning the ways of the Darkness and surviving despite them, much as I had to.\n\nBy confronting me with my lost fireteam and stirring up memories so painful, the Nightmares only confirm my earlier assumptions—I feel they are trying to distract us.\n\nRemain vigilant, no matter the cost.",

The energy emanating from the Pyramid has apparently attracted undesirable attention. If I am struggling to understand its potential, I wonder whether the Hidden Swarm has even scratched the surface.\n\nNonetheless, the Pyramid arrived on the Moon well before Guardians set foot here and remained unseen by us for eons. I spent years trapped in the Hellmouth, and all the while this force was buried beneath me, hidden by the Hive. If only I had known. How long has the Hidden Swarm been experimenting with the Pyramid's power? For all the Hive's efforts, they fortunately do not seem to have succeeded in penetrating the Pyramid's walls.\n\nNow that the Pyramid has activated, I sense a certain desperation in the Hidden Swarm. The Hive are frenzied. Their rituals and the appearance of Crota's daughter, Hashladûn, suggest that either the Hidden Swarm is seeking leadership, or it is so malleable that anyone desiring an army might claim them.\n\nWe cannot underestimate the Hidden Swarm. I know far too well what kind of damage these Hive are capable of. Too many victims have fallen to their bloodlust. I've… lost too much. Because of them, I lost my Ghost. I lost my eyes. They assumed me beaten. But they were wrong. I used their own dark magic against them, surviving and learning their tricks. I know where they are weak, a place only mentioned in whispers: the Catacombs. It is there that unknown shadows lurk, performing the most depraved rituals imaginable.\n\nShould some malignant force rise from the Darkness to guide them, I shudder to think what this brood could achieve.

He was assumed defeated by Guardians during the SIVA conflict, although he has come back from the dead so many times that I feel somewhat uncertain.\n\nAll I am sure of is that the Nightmares are growing stronger. They challenge my fortitude in a way I haven't experienced since my time in the Hellmouth.\n\nTaniks has changed in many respects over the years. He has enlisted the technology of the Fallen, Vex, and Humans to alter himself, out of necessity. He's a survivor, much like myself. Never in all my years did I think I would waver in my opinion of him, yet here I stand, sympathetic to a being who doesn't understand the meaning of the word.\n\nI sometimes question what kept me in the Hellmouth. Was I truly trapped there, or was I keeping myself there? Was it a self-imposed exile for the disastrous attempt at assassinating Crota? Was I a prisoner of my own making, doing penance for my mistakes? No. This can't be right.\n\nTaniks is a lawless murderer, with no moral code or ethics. There was that period, I am sure you recall, where it was assumed Cayde-6 had slain him, yet he returned—only to bring down Andal Brask in cold blood. Despicable.\n\nThis is not me; I'm no murderer. I fight for something better alongside all the Guardians of Light. This mission becomes more arduous by the day, but I am resolute in my cause.",

        "description": "My Queen,\n\nThe Kell of Kells. Skolas. A true Nightmare if ever I've seen one! I apologize, my Queen, if the mention his name unearths any foul memories. I know the toll it took on the Awoken when he waged his unholy war on the Reef, rallying the House of Wolves in an uprising that saw the loss of so many Awoken lives. We mourn them still to this day.\n\nSkolas's ambition was nothing if not relentless. In certain regards, I almost respect his sense of duty to his people. He was ruthless in his quest to lead his followers to glory. After his final revolt inside the Prison of Elders, Guardians banded together to thwart him once and for all—until today, when the Darkness summoned a Nightmare of him.\n\nI fear we may someday find ourselves in Skolas's place, shackled and bound, deprived of our friends and followers. Yet we cannot abandon hope… no matter how freeing it would be. To just give in to the Darkness. To give up. To feel no more pain.\n\nNo.\n\nSkolas was grueling to defeat. We must be the same.\n\nWe too shall adapt and become ruthless in hopes of staving off the Darkness. I feel the same sense of dedication to my people that Skolas felt for his. Death itself will have to claim me to end my campaign.\n\nThe weight of this mission is not overwhelming, though it feels heavier with each step forward. I will carry on.",

        "description": "My Queen,\n\nThe Red War was not so long ago. The Nightmare of Ghaul is an unwelcome reminder of the slaughter we faced. Many of us are still rebuilding after the atrocities committed by this murderous fiend. He orchestrated one of the greatest tragedies our people have endured when he tried to steal the Traveler for himself and harness its Light, destroying our homes and the Tower, massacring thousands of innocents in the process.\n\nGhaul's most odious transgression was not his attempted theft of the Traveler, nor his part in the Speaker's death, but his profane, self-aggrandized fantasy that he would be chosen to receive the Traveler's Light. It would amuse me to think this brute, who excelled only at betrayal and subterfuge, would ever be worthy of the Traveler's Light, had his misguided campaign not led to so much senseless bloodshed.\n\nLight stands for self-sacrifice and devotion. Light is the hope of a peaceful, harmonious world. Ghaul sought only power. He would never have been chosen for the Light.\n\nI often wonder whether I was chosen, or whether I made a choice in my journey through this life. Did fate make me, or did I make my own fate? I cannot say with great certainty, one way or the other. I can only assert that I choose what I feel to be right in any given moment and hope I made the right choice.\n\nI was relieved when Ghaul was defeated by the might of Guardians and destroyed by the Traveler's Light. It was reaffirming. I spare no pity for Ghaul, as he was a wretched creature who got what he deserved. His rage-fueled quest for power will not prove our greatest test, however. I dread that whatever comes creeping out of the darkness next will dwarf the devastation Ghaul brought forth. We must steel ourselves for what lies inside the Pyramid.",

I employ that same sense of duty. It's what drives me in our crusade against the Darkness and allows me to persevere, even when I feel pushed past my limits, much as I do now. I will not lie to you, my Queen: the very fabric of my mind feels twisted and frayed.\n\nI have always sensed something inherently dark in regard to the Vex. Specifics elude me for now, but I believe it warrants further scrutiny, should we survive this ordeal.\n\nThe ancient protectors of the Black Garden are rumored to contain code—not coordinates to a place, but potentially a key to time itself. Perhaps we can harness that code and erase the horrors of the past. We could save ourselves from the suffering and pain we're being forced to confront.\n\nIt sounds weak to hope for something so impossible, but trying to reconcile the distress has caused a lesion that I fear will never heal. The past has come back to torment me. For those I love, I will make sacrifices, but will there be anything left of me afterward?",
